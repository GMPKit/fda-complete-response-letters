Fremont, CA 94555

Dear Mr. Blanks:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated June 26, 2020, received June 29, 2020, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for tenapanor hydrochloride 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg tablets.

We acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated April 28, 2021, which extended the goal date by three months.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## CLINICAL

To support efficacy as monotherapy for reducing serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis, you submitted the results of two randomized, multi-center trials (TEN-02-201 and TEN-02-301). You also submitted the results of a third trial—a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (TEN-02-202), to support use in combination with existing phosphate binder treatment. All three studies evaluated tenapanor’s efficacy in reducing serum phosphorus levels.

In epidemiologic studies, elevated serum phosphorus levels have been associated with an increased risk of secondary hyperparathyroidism, vascular, valvular, and other soft tissue calcification and cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD. In patients on dialysis, higher serum phosphorus levels have also been associated with increased mortality.

To date, however, there are no data from outcome studies demonstrating that a treatment’s effect on serum phosphorus levels predicts its effect on clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events or mortality. Nevertheless, the Division of Cardiology and Nephrology, following the precedent set by the former Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products, treats serum phosphorus reduction as a valid surrogate in patients with CKD on dialysis. All currently marketed products for the control of serum phosphorus in patients with CKD on dialysis were approved based on effects on serum phosphorus levels. In the trials conducted to support approval, these therapies lowered serum phosphorus levels by ~1.5–2.2 mg/dL.

In both monotherapy trials, tenapanor’s efficacy in reducing serum phosphorus levels was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal period.  
- **Study TEN-02-201**: 8-week double-blind randomized treatment followed by withdrawal.  
- **Study TEN-02-301**: 26-week open-label randomized treatment followed by withdrawal.

In both studies, the primary efficacy analysis during the randomized withdrawal period was based on the **Efficacy Analysis Set**, a subset of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, limiting analysis to patients achieving a reduction of ≥ 1.2 mg/dL in serum phosphorus level.

### Enrollment and Completion:
- **TEN-02-301**: ~60% of patients randomized to tenapanor in the 26-week period completed the treatment and entered withdrawal.
- **TEN-02-201**: ~75% of 219 patients completed the 8-week period and entered withdrawal.
- Approximately half of the withdrawal participants were excluded from Efficacy Analysis Set.

### Treatment Effects:
- **Study TEN-02-301 (Efficacy Analysis Set)**: LS mean difference = 1.37 mg/dL.
- **Study TEN-02-201 & TEN-02-301 (ITT population)**: Effects of 0.72 mg/dL and 0.66 mg/dL, respectively.
- **Study TEN-02-202 (Combination therapy)**: Effect size = 0.65 mg/dL.

Subgroup analyses and response distributions did not identify a clearly responsive subpopulation. Exploratory analyses in TEN-02-301 suggested larger effects in patients with high baseline phosphorus, but inferior to the active control and lacking a placebo comparator.

Although the data support that tenapanor reduces serum phosphorus, the magnitude of effect is small and of unclear clinical significance. Precedent exists for approving drugs based on this surrogate endpoint, but not at the modest effect size presented.

### Next Steps
To approve this application:
- Conduct an **additional adequate and well-controlled trial** showing either:
  - A clinically relevant effect on serum phosphorus, or
  - Effect on a clinical outcome related to hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on dialysis.

Alternate strategies such as individualized treatment based on early response would need to be:
- Prospectively tested
- Based on multiple serum phosphorus assessments over time
