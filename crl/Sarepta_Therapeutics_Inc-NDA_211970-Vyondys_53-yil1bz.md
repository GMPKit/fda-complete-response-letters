## CLINICAL

### Benefits

- You submitted results from Study 4053-101 showing production of truncated dystrophin—a surrogate biomarker considered “reasonably likely” to predict clinical benefit.
- Golodirsen is being considered for accelerated approval under section 506(c) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 314, subpart H.
- Study highlights:
  - 25 evaluable patients
  - Western blot baseline mean dystrophin level: 0.10 ± 0.07 percent of normal
  - Week 48 dystrophin level: 1.02 ± 1.03 percent of normal
  - Mean increase: 0.92 ± 1.01 percent
- Mean increases in truncated dystrophin are similar to those seen with eteplirsen (0.9% increase).
- If this small increase (~0.9%) is reasonably likely to predict benefit, the benefit itself is likely to be at most very small.

### Risks

#### 1. Serious Infections

- Safety signals from postmarketing experience with eteplirsen show:
  - Reports of bacteremia, sepsis, septic shock, and deaths
  - 11 cases among 469 exposed patients (~2.3% frequency)
  - Cases were reported via PADERs and FAERS
  - The risk is likely underreported due to voluntary nature of FAERS
- The infections, although sometimes labeled as device-related, are directly linked to the use of implanted intravenous access ports required for drug administration
- Similar risks apply to golodirsen patients

#### Summary Table: Eteplirsen’s Postmarketing Reports of Infections

- In golodirsen clinical development (~30 patients via port over ~1.5 years):
  - ~30% had device-related AEs (pain, bruise, rash) but no serious infections
  - Estimated upper 95% CI on risk of serious infections ≈ 10%

#### 2. Renal Toxicity

- Observed in nonclinical animal studies:
  - Severe and irreversible renal damage in juveniles
  - Small safety margin
  - Some deaths from renal failure
- Clinical risk is magnified due to:
  1. **Urinary excretion** — Golodirsen is excreted unchanged via urine.
  2. **Monitoring challenges** — Creatinine is not reliable in DMD patients; alternatives like cystatin C and KIM-1 are unvalidated.
- No adequate renal monitoring paradigm currently exists.

---

## DISPARATE RISKS COMPARED TO ETEPLIRSEN

### Infections

- At time of eteplirsen approval (2016), serious infections were only theoretical
- Now shown to occur at ~2.3%
- Applicability to golodirsen is significant as the same delivery method is used

### Renal Toxicity

- Golodirsen shows higher risk than eteplirsen in animal models
- No viable method exists to advise patients via labeling

---

## DECISION

- The 2016 Commissioner’s decision on eteplirsen approval clarified that:  
  > "Each situation must be evaluated on its own merits based on the totality of data and information."

- Based on this principle:
  - Eteplirsen approval involved essentially no identified risks
  - Golodirsen carries:
    - Known risk of serious infections
    - Nonclinical renal toxicity with unmonitorable risk
  - Conclusion: **small unconfirmed benefit does not outweigh risks**

---

## CONFIRMING CLINICAL BENEFIT

- FDA notes that Sarepta's confirmatory study for eteplirsen has not begun — 2 years and 11 months post-approval
- Data from such a study would have informed current decision-making
- Suggests lack of due diligence on confirmatory trial is of concern

---

## PATH FORWARD

To proceed with approval, Sarepta must:

1. Provide substantial evidence of clinical benefit (e.g., via physical performance metrics)  
2. Develop practicable renal monitoring  
3. Avoid use of implanted ports if possible  

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENT

- Immunohistochemistry data collection via open muscle biopsy is discouraged  
- Less invasive needle biopsy is preferred for assessing dystrophin by Western blot  

---
