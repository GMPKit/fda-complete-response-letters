We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

1. Inadequate safety data to support the use of ZIMHI (Naloxone HCl Injection, 5 mg/0.5 mL) in community settings.

   **Safety concerns:**
   - No data showing intended users can deploy the needle safety guard effectively.
   - Risk of needlestick injuries and potential disease transmission.
   - Layperson users unfamiliar with product.

   ### To address this deficiency:
   - Modify the device to include an automatically deploying needle safety element.
   - Submit updated Use-Related Risk Analysis (URRA) considering UI changes:
     - Task analysis
     - Potential user errors and clinical consequences
     - Mitigation strategies
     - Validation methods for mitigation strategies
   - Conduct Human Factors (HF) validation study under simulated conditions.
     - Submit protocol for FDA feedback (60-day review period recommended).

## DEVICE RELIABILITY AND ANALYTICAL ISSUES

- Problems with Fault Tree Analyses and use of Cpk data:
  - Unclear source/use of failure rates
  - Lack of statistical validation of normality
  - Unsubstantiated failure rates impacting assembly reliability

- SN0057 submission deficiencies:
  - Invalid/incomplete methods
  - Non-representative samples
  - Conflicting data with shelf-life claims
  - No proof of real-time aging or component equivalency

### To address:
- Demonstrate device function under worst-case conditions (sterile, expired, shipped)
- Validate needle safety performance with guidance documents:
  - [Sharps Injury Prevention Features](https://www.fda.gov/files/medical%20devices/published/Medical-Devices-with-Sharps-Injury-Prevention-Features---Guidance-for-Industry-and-FDA-Staff-%28PDF%29.pdf)
  - [Non-Clinical Bench Performance Testing](https://www.fda.gov/media/113230/download)
  - [Voluntary Consensus Standards for Medical Devices](https://www.fda.gov/media/71983/download)

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

- No comment on labeling until application is otherwise acceptable.
- Use the following FDA tools:
  - [PLR Requirements](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)
  - [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)
  - [Structured Product Labeling (SPL)](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

- No comment until application is adequate.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

- **“Zimhi”** is conditionally acceptable, pending approval.
- Resubmit the name proposal with revised application.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

Submit a safety update under 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b), including:

1. New safety findings
2. Integrated original + new data, with AE comparisons
3. Updated discontinuation data
4. Case report forms/narratives for:
   - Deaths
   - AE-related discontinuations
   - Serious AEs
5. Updated common AE incidence
6. Subject exposure/time-on-product data
7. International safety and market report
8. Translated foreign labeling

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

1. Lack of correlation between extractables and leachables studies

   ### To address:
   - Conduct rigorous USP <1663>/<1664> studies to show correlation with leachable data

2. Leachable inconsistencies in stability testing

   ### To address:
   - Submit accelerated and freeze-thaw data
   - Report visual/physical observations

---

## DEVICE RELIABILITY

- Target reliability: **≥99.99% per device**
- Observed: **99.96%**, relying on two-device assumption (unacceptable)

  ### To address:
  - Adjust control strategy or redesign device
  - Submit data supporting ≥99.99% single-device reliability

---

## NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

- Incomplete toxicological assessment due to poor extractables/leachables data

  ### To address:
  - Submit updated risk assessment with:
    - Extractables/leachables above 5 mcg/day identified and evaluated
    - Toxicity thresholds (NOAEL) with published support
    - Complete referenced studies

---

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

- Study APC 6000-03 (Relative BA) arrived too late for review
- Unable to assess scientific bridge to Narcan

  > Comments deferred until full resubmission

---

## ACTIONS REQUIRED

- Take corrective action or resubmit within 1 year (per 21 CFR 314.110)
- Lack of action may be interpreted as withdrawal (21 CFR 314.65)
- Request extension if additional time needed
- Resubmission must:
  - Clearly address all deficiencies
