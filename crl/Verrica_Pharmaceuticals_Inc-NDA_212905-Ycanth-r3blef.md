## Safety Update

When responding to the above deficiencies, include a **safety update** as described at [21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b)].

The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration, regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
    - Present new safety data for the proposed indication using the same format as the original submission.
    - Present tabulations of new safety data combined with the original application data.
    - Include tables comparing frequencies of adverse events between the new and original data.
    - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for adverse event frequencies in clinical trials.
3. Present a retabulation of premature trial discontinuation reasons, incorporating drop-outs from newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for:
    - Each patient who died during a clinical trial.
    - Each patient who discontinued due to an adverse event.
    - Each serious adverse event.
5. Describe any substantial changes in the incidence of common but less serious adverse events.
6. Provide updated exposure information (e.g., number of subjects, person-time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide safety experience.
8. Provide English translations of current, approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

Attn: Patti Neall  
Executive Director, Regulatory Affairs  
10 N. High Street, Suite 200  
West Chester, PA 19380

### Product Quality

1. The proposed drug product specification lacks tests to ensure safe and accurate application. Add the following:
   - Test for crushing force of the glass ampule.
   - Leakage test after ampule crushing.
   - Droplet test to ensure controlled dispensing onto the lesion while avoiding healthy skin.

2. The extraction solutions used in the extractable/leachable study are considered inadequate. (b)(4)

---

### Human Factors

11. Review of human factors validation study noted:
    - One use error and three difficulties with the critical task "Break the Ampule".
    - Force required to break ampule (19 lbs.) exceeds average adult female palmar pinch force (16 lbs.).
    - Comparative analysis with Levulan Kerastick and Eskata is not sufficient.

    Concerns:
    - Risk of accidental exposure from premature cap removal or incorrect orientation.
    - Use-related risk analysis (URRA) misclassified certain tasks as non-critical. Tasks such as:
      - Inspect Applicator
      - Apply Solution
      - Allow Solution to Dry
      - Remove Cap

    These should be considered **critical tasks**.

Recommendations:
- Implement design changes to optimize applicator use.
- Conduct a new HF validation study after mitigation efforts.
- Submit revised HF protocol to the Agency for feedback (allow 60 days for review).
- Consider alternatives such as the Levulan Kerastick with a Krusher device.
- Revise Instructions for Use (IFU) to address readability and comprehension issues.
