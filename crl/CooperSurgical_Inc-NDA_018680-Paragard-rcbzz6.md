# NDA 018680/S-074  
## COMPLETE RESPONSE

**To:**  
CooperSurgical, Inc.  
Attention: Regina Shih  
Vice President, Global Regulatory and Clinical Affairs  
75 Corporate Drive  
Trumbull, CT 06611

Please refer to your supplemental new drug application (sNDA) dated and received February 28, 2023, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Paragard (intrauterine copper contraceptive).

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated November 20, 2023, which was not reviewed for this action.

This “Prior Approval” efficacy supplement to your application provides for a new inserter intended to facilitate the single-hand placement of Paragard.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reason for this action below and our recommendation to address this deficiency.

## Deficiency Identified

### Facility Inspections

During our recent inspection of the CooperSurgical, Inc. (FEI: 1316626, NY, USA) manufacturing facility, our field investigator could not complete the inspection because the facility was not ready for inspection. A satisfactory inspection is required before this application may be approved. Notify us in writing when this facility is ready for inspection.

## Additional Information and Comments

### Prescribing Information

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources) and [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule) websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) − a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

Regarding your submission dated November 20, 2023, containing draft labeling for Paragard, we recommend you include that version as draft labeling in your resubmission.

Prior to resubmitting the labeling, use the SRPI checklist to correct any formatting errors to ensure conformance with the format items in regulations and guidances.

### Carton and Container Labeling

We have the following Carton Labeling and Placement Guide recommendations that are not approvability issues:

1. The placeholder for the lot number is missing. Add the placeholder in accordance with 21 CFR 201.10(i)(1).
2. The placeholder for the expiration date is missing and the format is undefined. Add a placeholder per USP General Chapter <7>. Ensure no other numbers are located close to the expiration date. FDA recommends:
   - YYYY-MM-DD if numeric
   - YYYY-MMM-DD if month is abbreviated alphabetically
   - If space-limited: YYYY-MM or YYYY-MMM
   - Use hyphen or slash between elements
3. The product identifier is missing. If requirements apply, add placeholder referencing the [Product Identifier Guidance (June 2021)](https://www.fda.gov/media/117301/download).
4. NDC number lacks prominence due to small font size — consider increasing font size.
5. The “Master Carton” contains additional language not present on the carton. Remove irrelevant content. Clarify the purpose of this master carton.
6. The proposed inserter performs differently from other IUS products. Add:  
   > “Read the Preparation Instructions and Insertion Procedure before initiating Paragard insertion because different inserters perform differently.”
7. Inconsistent terminology on the carton for Prescribing Information and Patient Information labeling. Revise to be consistent with actual document titles (e.g., replace placeholder language with “Patient Information” and “Prescribing Information”).
8. The far-left and far-right panels on your Placement Guide also serve as the container label, creating clutter. Some container label info is missing (e.g., lot number, linear barcode). Develop a separate container label (e.g., sticker on sterile packaging). Refer to:  
   *Guidance for Industry: Safety Considerations for Container Labels and Carton Labeling Design to Minimize Medication Errors.*
9. Placement Guide is proposed to be inside sterile packaging. This prevents review prior to procedure. Consider providing an additional copy inside the carton but outside sterile packaging.
10. Step 1 in Placement Guide lacks critical information:
    - No instruction to keep button in place while moving forward into tray
    - No warning to avoid pressing button repeatedly
    - No instruction to keep tray horizontal  
    Consider:
    - Adding “Keep button in position shown” in Step 1
    - Labeling the "neutral line"
    - Adding “Keep tray flat on sterile horizontal surface”
11. Prominently describe unique tasks related to Paragard and proposed inserter:
    - Include neutral line description in Step 1 illustration
    - Resolve inconsistencies in neutral line position in Steps 1, 2, 5
    - Improve Steps 5 and 6 to show deployment at fundus  
      Example:
      - Step 2 shows neutral line in a different location compared to Steps 1 and 5
12. Step 7 of the Placement Guide should be revised for clarity:
    - Move “IMPORTANT:” statement to left panel or to container label
    - Replace unclear references with precise terms such as “instructions in the Prescribing Information”
