Dear Ana Vaz:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated and received September 28, 2022, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for lebrikizumab injection.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

1. As part of the facility evaluation of the drug substance manufacturing facility, a Remote Regulatory Assessment (RRA) was performed. FDA identified issues during the RRA and conducted a pre-license inspection (PLI) to further evaluate the facility. Following the PLI, FDA conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. FDA has reviewed the responses from the facility, and all deficiencies have not been satisfactorily resolved. Satisfactory responses to these deficiencies should be provided to the inspection team prior to submitting your complete response. Your complete response should include the date of the facility’s response to the FDA Form 483. The assessment of the application approvability and resolution of inspection deficiencies would be evaluated upon receipt of the complete response and may include a re-inspection of the facility. Please work with the facility in resolving the related deficiencies.

2. Following evaluation of the inspection findings noted above, and the response to those findings, the Agency has identified concerns regarding the reliability of data generated at (b)(4) in your BLA submission. The concerns impact data that supports comparability between commercial and clinical materials to ensure expected clinical outcome demonstrated by clinical material can be achieved by commercial material. Further, the adequacy of the proposed lebrikizumab drug substance (DS) manufacturing process and overall control strategy cannot be determined at this time to support the licensure of lebrikizumab. For resolution, we recommend you engage with an independent third party to develop a protocol for, and conduct, a comprehensive assessment on the impacted information and data submitted in your application to justify the acceptability of using these data and information to support licensure. We recommend you also confirm with the FDA that the protocol is adequate to ensure that the audit will cover the data reliability concerns identified. If any impacted data are removed from the application and/or changes are made to the control strategy to address the facility deficiencies, provide additional information and data (e.g., testing results from repeated studies) that are reliable and accurate to support that consistent process performance and product quality is achieved.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

3. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources) and [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule) websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) − a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

4. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

## PROPRIETARY NAME

5. Please refer to correspondence dated December 14, 2022, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Ebglyss. This name was found conditionally acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to all of the application deficiencies that have been identified in this letter.

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

The safety update should:

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.
3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each subject who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

### Product Quality:

- Reference is made to your September 13, 2023, response to Question 2 of the FDA September 7, 2023, information request (IR) with respect to the pre-filled syringe needle safety device (PFS-NSD) drug product (DP) manufacturing process at (b)(4). While a re-evaluation of the process validation data against the...
