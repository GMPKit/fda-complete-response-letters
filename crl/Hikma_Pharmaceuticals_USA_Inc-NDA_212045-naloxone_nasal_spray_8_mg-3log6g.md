## Product Quality

1. **Extractables Studies**
   - Different MDDs used for AET calculation:
     - 2011 report: 8 mg/day for volatiles/semi-volatiles/non-volatiles
     - TTP-IOX-M0083: 32 mg/day for polar compounds/elemental impurities
     - Action: Clarify discrepancy and provide revised AETs with correct MDD
   - Provide missing profile information in resubmission

2. **Leachable Studies**
   - FDA disagrees with use of ICH Q1D bracketing/matrixing design—full protocol required
   - Only horizontal orientation tested—redo in inverted orientation or justify
   - Adopted AET (μg/mL) was 100x extractables AET—many reporting limits exceeded
     - Revise and clarify using SCT (μg/day)

3. Acceptance criteria for total impurities are too wide—tighten based on trend data

4. Include acceptance criterion for degradation impurity (ICH Q3B) or support absence with batch data

5. Analytical method must detect (b)(4) despite vendor COA control

6. **Method Validation Deficiencies**
   - Provide forced degradation for CH.0103
   - Add system suitability to methods:
     - CH.0151, CH.0109, CH.0117, CH.0110
   - Submit full validation for Impurity (b)(4) and Report.CH.0046 for CH.0109

7. **Impurity Structure Assignment**
   - Justify MS diagnostic signal
   - Submit direct spectroscopic evidence
   - If unconfirmed, list as specified unknown with RRT

8. Provide primary container label design and material details

9. Provide vendor COA for vial

10. Formulation with EDTA shows optimal pH—justify broader pH or provide supporting data

---

## Manufacturing

11. Revise proposed commercial batch record (section 3.2.P.3.3)

12. Submit leachable/extractable data for manufacturing contact materials:
    - Data for all formulation-contact components
    - Compliance statements for ASTM and CFR

13. No acceptance criteria for pH/viscosity/density:
    - Justify using batch data
    - Submit comparative table: commercial vs. exhibit batch specs
    - Update sections 3.2.P.3.4 and batch record

14. Improper reconciliation/yield data:
    - Revise to include actual yield/target per CFR 211.103, 211.186(b)(7)

15. Columbus, OH site not ready—notify FDA when ready for inspection

---

## Center for Devices and Radiological Health

16. October 18, 2019 response left Q12, Q14, Q16–23 incomplete—address all in full

17. Alcohol formulation in reliability studies not justified:
    - Submit full data on:
      - Spray actuation/dose accuracy
      - Spray pattern
      - Spray content uniformity
      - Droplet size distribution
      - Plume geometry
      - Actuation force

18. Submit full internal CAPA procedure covering:
    - Process analysis, disposition, statistics, investigations, actions, documentation, etc.

---

## Nonclinical

19. Extractable/leachable data inadequate for tox assessment:
    - Resubmit risk assessment for compounds ≥ 5 mcg/day

---

## Human Factors

20. Incomplete user interface data:
    - Refer to Advice Letters (April 26, August 9, 2019)
    - Update risk analysis and submit HF validation results

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Update PI per 21 CFR 201.56(a)/(d) and 201.57:

- [Physician Labeling Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)
- [Pregnancy & Lactation Labeling Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)

Submit:
- PI in SPL format ([FDA guidance](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm))
- Marked and clean Word versions  
- Use SRPI checklist, sample formats, and EPC phrases

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

1. State alcohol content on carton as % v/v absolute alcohol

2. Add equivalency statements to PI and labeling:  
   “Naloxone hydrochloride 8 mg (equivalent to 7.2 mg naloxone) in 0.1 mL”

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

Submit per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b):

1. Safety profile changes  
2. Updated AE tables:
   - New vs. original
   - Proposed indication trials + combined results
   - Other indications separately  
3. Premature discontinuation data  
4. Narratives and case forms for SAEs and deaths
