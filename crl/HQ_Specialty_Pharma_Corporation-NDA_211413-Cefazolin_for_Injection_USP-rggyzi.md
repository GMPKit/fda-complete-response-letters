### NONCLINICAL

Unless otherwise justified, nonclinical studies conducted to qualify the safety of leachables should be designed such that the identified leachables are administered in a clinically relevant manner at levels that are equivalent to or greater than what patients would be administered when incorporating interspecies allometric scaling.

The information provided in your complete response does not adequately qualify the safety of the identified leachables with your drug product. Specifically:

1. The 14-day toxicity study in rats does not achieve clinically relevant leachables exposures, with animals receiving less than the leachables/day when compared with the maximum estimated daily leachables exposure in patients.

2. You have proposed an acceptable intake of **(b)(4)** mcg/day for the identified leachables. While it is recognized that PQRI may inform on the safety of the identified leachables when administered at clinically relevant exposures, this proposal is insufficient.

Submit a leachables assessment plan and/or justification that the leachables in the drug product to be administered to animals are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the identified leachables described in Study Report TE190276.

If any additional leachables are characterized on further testing, or if there are any revised or new structures compared to those previously identified, you should:

- Conduct additional (Q)SAR evaluation(s) for bacterial mutagenicity.
- If applicable, conduct a follow-up Ames test (bacterial reverse mutation assay) to qualify leachables that exceed 120 mcg/day with identified structural alerts for genotoxic potential.

### PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

We encourage you to review the following labeling review resources:

- [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)

Use the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format regulations and guidance.

Include updated content of labeling in SPL format as described at:  
[Structured Product Labeling on FDA.gov](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

### SAFETY UPDATE

When responding to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). Include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration, regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. For adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables comparing frequencies of adverse events from original vs updated data.
   - Provide separate tables for other indications.
3. Present a retabulation of premature trial discontinuation reasons incorporating new trial data.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who:
   - Died during a trial
   - Did not complete a trial due to an adverse event
   - Experienced serious adverse events
5. Describe changes in the incidence of common, less serious adverse events.
6. Provide updated exposure information (e.g., number of subjects, person-time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide safety experience and updated use estimates for markets outside the U.S.
8. Submit English translations of any current approved foreign labeling not previously provided.

### OTHER REQUIREMENTS

- Within one year of this letter, you must resubmit the application or take other actions under 21 CFR 314.110.
- Failure to respond may be treated as a request to withdraw the application (21 CFR 314.65).
- You may request an extension for resubmission.

A resubmission must:

- Fully address all deficiencies
- Be clearly marked as "**RESUBMISSION**" in large, bold font at the beginning of the cover letter
- State that it is a complete response to deficiencies

A partial response will not begin a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting/teleconference. Submit the meeting request as described in the draft FDA guidance:

- [Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products](https://www.fda.gov/media/109951/download)

> You may not legally market the drug product until the FDA notifies you in writing that the application is approved.

## Additional NONCLINICAL Issues

You have not adequately qualified the safety of the identified leachables. Issues and recommendations:

1. QSAR alone is not sufficient, except for mutagenicity. In absence of published toxicity data, a 5 mcg/day threshold is recommended for parenteral products.
2. Leachables containing API fragments: ICH Q3B threshold of 0.15% is not sufficient to qualify their safety.
3. Conduct a 14-day general toxicity study in one species for any leachable exceeding 5 mcg/day.

> Ames test, in vitro mutagenicity (e.g., Mouse Lymphoma Assay) recommended for leachables > 120 mcg/day with genotoxic alerts.

Refer to:

- [FDA Guidance – S2(R1)](https://www.fda.gov/media/71980/download)
- [OECD Genetic Toxicology Guidance](https://www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/testing/Genetic%20Toxicology%20Guidance%20Document%20Aug%2031%202015.pdf)

### Additional Notes on Final GLP Report

- GLP Report "14-Day Toxicity Study Via IV Injection in Sprague Dawley Rats with 14-Day Recovery" submitted Dec 6, 2019 was too late in the review cycle to be considered.
- You may reference it in your resubmission.

---

## IMPURITIES ISSUES

1. Specifications from Sep 14, 2018 amendment have unspecified impurities above thresholds. ANDA guidance is not applicable to this NDA.
   - Submit qualification data for impurities above the threshold.
   - Additional nonclinical studies may be necessary per ICH Q3B(R2).

2. No structure identification or characterization was submitted for unidentified impurities—only RRTs. This is inadequate.
   - Submit full characterization data for these impurities.

3. Analytical methods were updated but not validated for these impurities.
   - Validate the methods for these specified impurities.

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

Submit revised carton and container labeling.

### Container Label

Use clear expiration date formats such as:

- `31JAN2013`
- `JAN2013`
- `2013-JAN-31`
- `2013-01-31`

### Carton Label

- Include lot number and expiration date in distinct locations.
- Avoid close proximity to other numbers.
- Follow same expiration date formats as above.
