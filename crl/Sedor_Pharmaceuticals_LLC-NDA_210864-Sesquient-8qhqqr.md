## Product Quality

It is crucial from a safety perspective that the drug product does not contain foreign particles. Information provided to date has not adequately addressed this drug product quality issue.

In a quality information amendment submitted on December 6, 2019, you provided additional study results regarding particles in the drug product. You concluded that the initial particulate information, obtained in association with testing, was erroneous and not representative of the drug product due to testing environment conditions. However, sufficient information is lacking to confirm that the initial results are erroneous.

We are unable to disregard these results.

- Characterize the particles observed in the drug product and identify the root cause of their presence (e.g., container closure system, testing method/conditions, manufacturing equipment)
- Provide a Risk Mitigation & Control Plan to mitigate the presence of particulates in your drug product
- Provide data demonstrating that actions taken will prevent reoccurrence of particles

---

## Regulatory

Your original application, submitted May 22, 2018, relied in part on FDA’s finding of safety and effectiveness for Parke Davis’s NDA 020450 for Cerebyx (fosphenytoin sodium) injection.  

### Findings:

1. **Reliance on NDA 206030 (Carnexiv):**
    - Reliance is needed to justify safety of Captisol.
    - Submit an updated FDA Form 356h reflecting reliance only on Cerebyx and Carnexiv NDAs.

2. **Paragraph IV Certifications:**
    - Your submission included Paragraph IV certifications for patents listed under Carnexiv NDA 206030:  
      - 7,635,773  
      - 8,410,077  
      - 9,493,582  
      - 9,750,822  
    - You must send notice of Paragraph IV certification and documentation of receipt by Cydex Pharmaceuticals.

3. **Documentation Issues:**
    - Two Domestic Return Receipts submitted (dated Sept 23, 2019) lacked delivery date.
    - Provide documentation showing actual delivery date to Lundbeck.
