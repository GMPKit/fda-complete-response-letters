# CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH  
**APPLICATION NUMBER:** 205394Orig1s000  
**OTHER ACTION LETTERS**

## 2) Drug Product Stability

We acknowledge the out-of-specification (OOS) investigations submitted in response to the September 26, 2019, action letter. However, due to the manufacturing process deficiencies described in Item 1, stability data from existing exhibit batches cannot be used as primary data for establishing product shelf life. Therefore, we recommend:

a) Submit 12 months of long-term stability data for exhibit batches manufactured as recommended in Comment 1. Stability testing should be performed using fully validated methods. Suitability of analytical equipment should be verified prior to use. Shelf life will be based on review of this stability data.

b) If intending to use 2017 or 2018 batch stability results as supportive data, provide raw HPLC data for all corrected analytical results. Additionally, regarding INV-2019-017, to support disqualification of the OOS stability results, further investigation is needed to identify the root cause.

---

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

3. During a recent inspection of the drug substance manufacturing facility for this NDA, our investigator observed objectionable conditions. Satisfactory resolution is required. Please list communications submitted to or held with the Agency to resolve these observations.

4. During inspection of IntelGenx Corp. (FEI 3005721224), objectionable conditions were observed at the drug product manufacturing facility. Manufacture of new exhibit batches tested per cGMPs is recommended. A follow-up Pre-Approval Inspection may be needed.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. Please review relevant labeling resources:

- [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)

Use the SRPI checklist when revising labeling and include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format:  
[Structured Product Labeling Info](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

### General Comments:

- Revise the usual dose statement to:  
  `Recommended Dosage: See prescribing information.`

- Ensure temperature statements contain °C or °F designations after each number.  
  Recommended format: `59°F to 77°F (15°C to 25°C)`

---

### Container Labels:

1. Clarify expiration date format—numerical (e.g., 06) or alphabetical (e.g., JUN). Use format: `YYYY-MM-DD` if space permits.

3. Strength layout inconsistent. Present as:

    ```
    RIZAPORT
    (rizatriptan)
    oral film
    10 mg
    ```

4. Add use instructions:

    > Use dry hands. Place film on tongue. Keep in place until film dissolves.

#### B. Carton Labeling

1. Reduce prominence of net quantity statement.

2. Add statement:  
   > Keep product in pouch until ready to use.

#### C. References
