**COMPLETE RESPONSE**

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, SA  
Attention: Hari Nagaradona, PhD  
VP and Head of Regulatory Affairs  
107 College Road East  
Princeton, NJ 08540

Dear Dr. Nagaradona:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received September 14, 2015, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Xeglyze (abametapir) Lotion, 0.74%.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

During a recent inspection of the Dr. Reddy’s Lab Ltd. CTO Unit VI (FEI 3002949085) manufacturing facility for this NDA, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this NDA may be approved.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) − a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the prescribing information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

<http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm>

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Please refer to correspondence dated, November 30, 2015, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Xeglyze. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.  
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.  
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.  
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.  
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.  
3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.  
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.  
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.  
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).  
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.  
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.  

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. You may also request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly marked with "**RESUBMISSION**" in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial response to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your meeting request as described in the FDA Guidance for Industry, “Formal Meetings Between FDA and Sponsors or Applicants,” May 2009:

<http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM153222.pdf>

The drug product may not be legally marketed until you have been notified in writing that this application is approved.

## PDUFA V APPLICANT INTERVIEW

FDA has contracted with Eastern Research Group, Inc. (ERG) to conduct an independent interim and final assessment of the Program for Enhanced Review Transparency and Communication for NME NDAs and Original BLAs under PDUFA V (“the Program”). The PDUFA V Commitment Letter states that these assessments will include interviews with applicants following FDA action on applications reviewed in the Program. For this purpose, first-cycle actions include approvals, complete responses, and withdrawals after filing. 

The purpose of the interview is to better understand applicant experiences with the Program and its ability to improve transparency and communication during FDA review.

ERG will contact you to schedule a PDUFA V applicant interview and provide specifics about the interview process. Your responses during the interview will be confidential with respect to the FDA review team. ERG has signed a non-disclosure agreement and will not disclose any identifying information to anyone outside their project team. They will report only anonymized results and findings in the interim and final assessments. Members of the FDA review team will be interviewed by ERG separately.

While your participation in the interview is voluntary, your feedback will be helpful to these assessments.

If you have any questions, call Cristina Attinello, Senior Regulatory Project Manager, at (301) 796-3986.

Sincerely,
