## NDA 215212 - COMPLETE RESPONSE

**HQ Specialty Pharma Corporation**  
Attention: Stephanie Boffa  
Vice President Regulatory Affairs  
120 Route 17 North, Suite 130  
Paramus, NJ 07652

Dear Ms. Boffa,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated November 16, 2020, received November 16, 2020, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), for Meropenem for Injection 2 g/vial.

We also refer to your amendments dated January 5 and 15, February 1 and 16, March 31, April 9 and 30, and July 12 and 13, 2021.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## NONCLINICAL

1. We acknowledge your plan to initiate your “14-Day Repeat Dose Toxicity Study via Intravenous Injection in Beagle Dogs with a 14-Day Recovery Period” to qualify the identified leachables. However, since preliminary findings will not be available before the PDUFA goal date (September 16, 2021), we cannot rely on this study.

   The submitted risk assessment is inadequate for the following reasons:

   - Use of the Cramer decision tree is not acceptable; FDA recommends a 5 mcg/day threshold for non-genotoxic leachables.
   - Application of modified Haber’s rule is inappropriate for leachables qualification.
   - (Q)SAR analysis is insufficient for qualifying general toxicity endpoints aside from mutagenicity.

### Information Needed to Resolve the Deficiency

We recommend proceeding with the planned 14-Day Repeat Dose Toxicity Study in beagle dogs using the cefazolin drug product. Submit the final, complete study report with a future NDA resubmission.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

2. The amendment dated April 30, 2021 (SDN 011) includes a proposal to apply an overfill. However, the amount exceeds USP General Chapter <1151> recommendations.

### Information Needed to Resolve the Deficiency

Provide study results justifying the proposed overfill. Confirm the labeled drug amount is consistently withdrawable per instructions. Adjust and justify labeling instructions as needed based on findings.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

Review the following resources:

- [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

Use the SRPI checklist to ensure Prescribing Information format compliance. Updated labeling content must be submitted in SPL format via [FDA Structured Product Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

Include a safety update per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). This should address all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials, irrespective of indication, dosage form, or dose.

Include:

1. Detailed descriptions of significant safety changes.
2. New clinical trial safety data:
   - Same format as original submission.
   - Combined tabulation with original application data.
   - Tables comparing original vs updated adverse event frequencies.
   - Separate tables for non-proposed indications.
3. Retabulate premature discontinuation reasons to include recent dropouts.
4. Case report forms and narrative summaries for:
   - Deaths
   - Serious adverse events
   - AE-related discontinuations
5. Description of substantial changes in common but less serious AE incidences.
6. Updated clinical studies/trials exposure figures.
7. Global safety data and updated worldwide use estimates.
8. English translations of any newly available foreign labeling.

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

These items are not approvability issues but should be addressed:

### CLINICAL

1. Clarify whether the proposal regarding (redacted info) is still active and submit associated safety data. Update the PI, highlighting all changes.
2. Justify omission of other indications included in the reference product labeling.

### CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY

Section 12.4 organism listings in the PI must align strictly with indicated use.

## OTHER

You are required to resubmit or take alternate action within one year per 21 CFR 314.110.

A valid resubmission must:

- Fully address all deficiencies.
- Be clearly marked as **"RESUBMISSION"** in bold, large font on the cover letter.
