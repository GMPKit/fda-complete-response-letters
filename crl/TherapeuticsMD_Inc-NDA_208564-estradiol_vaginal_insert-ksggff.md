Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received July 7, 2016, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for estradiol vaginal insert, 4, 10.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL SAFETY

1. Your application does not provide long-term endometrial safety data for the 4, 10 mcg estradiol vaginal inserts. Sufficient assessment of endometrial histology to support chronic use is critical to the safety evaluation of unopposed estrogen and to ensure adequate labeling for the safe use of your product. In making this determination, we have considered the following:
   - Treatment of moderate-to-severe dyspareunia, due to menopause, involves a chronic duration.
   - Unopposed estrogen use in a postmenopausal woman with a uterus increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia/cancer.
   - 12-week safety data from Trial TXV14-01 are inadequate to assess long-term endometrial safety of your estradiol vaginal insert.
   - Long-term endometrial safety data with your product are necessary to ensure its safe use.
     - Clinical practice allows the chronic treatment of local vaginal symptoms related to menopause, such as dyspareunia, with vaginally administered estrogen without opposing progestin therapy to mitigate the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in women with a uterus.
     - Proliferative changes of the endometrium were seen with your product in some women at 12 weeks of treatment compared to none on placebo. Based on these 12-week endometrial changes, it is unclear, without long-term data, whether your product could be used without an opposing progestin even if it is intended for local vaginal use.
     - Long-term endometrial safety information with your product in labeling is essential to guide prescribers’ decisions regarding endometrial surveillance and the need for progestin therapy with the chronic use of your product in a woman with a uterus.
     - If long-term endometrial data are not reassuring and indicate that your product must be co-administered with a progestin for adequate endometrial protection, then the safety and efficacy of the co-administered drugs will need to be demonstrated.

2. The safety evaluation of your product is expected to quantify and characterize the general safety of the drug over a reasonable duration consistent with its intended chronic use. Such extended duration of exposure is needed to adequately characterize the pattern of drug-related adverse reactions over time or to detect adverse reactions that may occur only with a longer duration of treatment.

To address the aforementioned deficiencies, you will need to conduct and provide data from a long-term endometrial trial of sufficient size and duration to adequately characterize endometrial safety with your product. This trial should also collect and characterize the long-term general safety profile of your product. You are encouraged to request a meeting with us to discuss the details of such a trial.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) − a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the prescribing information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.
3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug/product. Include an updated estimate of use for drug/product marketed in other countries.
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

### Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls

- We remind you that the current USP includes a monograph for Estradiol Vaginal Inserts.
- If your product deviates from the USP monograph requirements, these deviations should be identified on your product labels.
- We recommend that you petition the USP with proposed revisions to the monograph to accommodate your new drug product.

Visit: http://www.usp.org/usp-nf/pending-monographs  

- Differences noted:
  - Assay test method and acceptance criteria
  - Dissolution test method and acceptance criteria
  - Procedure for determining related substances

- The proposed analysis of estradiol-related compounds and degradation impurities by HPLC-MS is currently unacceptable for regulatory purposes.

- For dissolution test method:
  - Perform dissolution method validation in accordance with USP <1092>, The Dissolution Procedure: Development and Validation.
  - Adopt appropriate acceptance criteria.

### Carton and Container Labeling

**Carton Labeling:**
- Insufficient differentiation between the strengths due to overlapping trade dress colors (green, pink, and purple).  
- The dosage form is incorrectly labeled. Revise all labels to state “vaginal insert”.  
- The established name lacks prominence commensurate with the proprietary name. Increase prominence per 21 CFR 201.10(g)(2).  
- Relocate the statement of strength to immediately follow the dosage form to prevent overlooking important information.

**Blister Label:**
- Lacks drug-identifying information per 21 CFR 201.10(i)(1) and 21 CFR 201.17.
- Include:
  - Proprietary and established name
  - Product strength
  - Lot or control number
  - Expiration date (`MMMYYYY` or `MMMDDYYYY`)
  - Name of manufacturer, packer, or distributor

### Proprietary Name

- Review of your proposed proprietary name has been terminated due to the application deficiencies.
- Resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the deficiencies.

---

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions under 21 CFR 314.110. Otherwise, we may consider your lack of response as a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65.

- A resubmission must fully address all deficiencies and should be clearly marked **"RESUBMISSION"** in large font, bolded type on the cover letter of the submission.
- The cover letter should clearly state that it is a complete response.
- A partial response will not start a new review cycle.
