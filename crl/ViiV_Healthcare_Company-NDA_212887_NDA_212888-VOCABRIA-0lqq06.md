Attention: Beth Austin, PhD

Research Triangle Park, NC 27709

Dear Dr. Austin,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated April 29, 2019, received April 29, 2019, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for VOCABRIA® (cabotegravir) 30 mg tablets.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendation to address the issue.

### PRODUCT QUALITY

We have identified deficiencies in the product quality information for CABENUVA® (cabotegravir extended release injectable suspension + rilpivirine extended release injectable suspension) 600 mg/900 mg co-pack NDA. As the approval of the VOCABRIA (cabotegravir) NDA is contingent on the approval of the CABENUVA NDA, the CABENUVA NDA deficiencies must be adequately addressed before this application can be approved.

### PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources:

- [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

- [Structured Product Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

Provide:
- A highlighted or marked-up copy showing all changes
- A clean Microsoft Word version
- Annotations supporting any changes

### CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

Submit latest draft carton and container labeling based on your proposed revision dated December 18, 2019.

### PROPRIETARY NAME

Refer to correspondence dated July 1, 2019, regarding the proposed proprietary name VOCABRIA. The name was found acceptable pending approval. Resubmit the name when responding to deficiencies.

### SAFETY UPDATE

Include a safety update in your response as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b):

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. Incorporate new safety data:
   - Present new safety data in the format of the original submission.
   - Tabulate new data combined with the original data.
   - Include tables comparing frequencies of adverse events.
   - Provide separate tables for indications other than the proposed one.
3. Present a retabulation of reasons for premature trial discontinuation.
4. Provide:
   - Case report forms
   - Narrative summaries for deaths or serious adverse events
5. Describe changes in incidence of common adverse events.
6. Provide updated exposure information.
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience and estimated use.
8. Provide English translations of foreign labeling not previously submitted.

### OTHER

Respond within one year or appropriate regulatory actions may be taken under 21 CFR 314.65. A resubmission must:

- Fully address all deficiencies
- Be clearly marked "RESUBMISSION"
- Include a cover letter stating it is a complete response

Request a meeting or teleconference if guidance is needed, as described in the draft guidance on formal meetings.

The drug product may not legally be marketed until written approval is received.
