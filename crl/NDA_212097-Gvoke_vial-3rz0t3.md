# NDA 212097/S-012

## Information and Data of Comparative Dose Accuracy Testing

Information and data of comparative dose accuracy testing between your proposed product and the relied-upon listed drug supporting complete dose delivered of glucagon without submicron particle formation events prior to administration as provided in the labeling. Dose accuracy testing may be examined by glucagon content assay in a diluted solution collected after delivery via syringes with needles. Dynamic light scattering analysis may be used to determine submicron particles in a diluted glucagon solution after delivery.

> We strongly recommend that you discuss the acceptability of your bridging strategy with the Agency by requesting a meeting prior to resubmitting your application.

## Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls

1. The data provided in the supplement do not support compatibility and stability of the proposed IV administration. Compatibility studies following dilution were provided for the XP-9164 formulation under IND 156281. Provide admixture studies using your proposed formulation (Gvoke vial, rather than XP-9164) to inform drug product compatibility and stability for the proposed dosing and administration technique (i.e., as provided in the labeling Section 2.4). These studies should include comparative gelling and agglomeration studies using the Gvoke vial formulation with the relied-upon listed drug.

## Prescribing Information

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the:

- [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

...including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) â€” a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

- [SPL format page](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

## Carton and Container Labeling

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

## Proprietary Name

Please refer to correspondence dated September 14, 2023, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Gvoke VialDx. This name was found conditionally acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to all of the application deficiencies that have been identified in this letter.

## Safety Update

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
    - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
    - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the supplemental application data.
    - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the supplemental application with the retabulated frequencies described in the bullet above.
    - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.
3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each subject who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the supplemental application data.
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## Other

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. You may also request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial response to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your meeting request as described in the draft guidance for industry:

- Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products  
  [FDA Guidance Documents](https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm)
