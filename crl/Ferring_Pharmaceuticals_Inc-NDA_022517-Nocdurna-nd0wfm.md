## COMPLETE RESPONSE – January 30, 2015

**To:**  
Brenda Marczi, Pharm.D.  
Vice President, U.S. Regulatory Affairs

### CLINICAL/STATISTICAL

- Insufficient evidence to conclude that the effect of Nocdurna on nocturnal voids is clinically meaningful and outweighs the risks of hyponatremia.  
- A new trial is required:
  - Must demonstrate meaningful clinical benefit (e.g., using validated patient-reported outcome instruments).
  - Should evaluate prospective strategies to monitor hyponatremia in the postmarketing setting.

### PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

- FDA reserves comment on proposed labeling until the application is considered adequate.  
- Refer to PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information and Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) checklist.  
- Revised labeling must be submitted in SPL format.

### PROPRIETARY NAME

- Name "Nocdurna" is acceptable pending application approval.  
- Resubmit name upon deficiency resolution.

### SAFETY UPDATE

Include the following in your response:

1. Describe significant safety profile changes or findings.  
2. Assemble adverse event data:
   - Present new safety data in original NDA format.
   - Combine new and original safety data in tabular format.
   - Include comparative tables for adverse event frequency.  
3. Retabulate premature discontinuations, incorporating new dropouts.  
4. Submit case report forms and narrative summaries:
   - For deaths during clinical trials.
   - For serious adverse events and treatment-related discontinuations.  
5. Note any substantial changes in incidence of common adverse events.  
6. Provide updated subject exposure data.  
7. Submit global safety summary with drug usage estimates.  
8. Provide English translations of foreign labeling if not already submitted.

### OTHER

- Response or action required within one year under 21 CFR 314.110.  
- Request extension or meeting as needed under 21 CFR 314.102(d).  
- Application cannot be approved or legally marketed until formal written notice is received.

## COMPLETE RESPONSE – January 30, 2013

**To:**  
Laura Cooper  
Director, Regulatory Affairs

### CLINICAL/STATISTICAL

- Modest treatment effect size and unclear benefit.  
- CS40 (women): Nocdurna 25 mcg was nominally significant, but results were not robust.  
- CS41 (men): Statistically significant results for 50 mcg and 75 mcg doses.  
- Hyponatremia incidents noted at all Nocdurna doses.  
- Behavior and lifestyle modifications likely affected baseline.  
- Patient-reported outcomes (NQoL, WPAI) previously deemed unacceptable.  
- Nocturnal Impact Diary acceptable but inadequately powered.  

Trial required to demonstrate a clinically meaningful reduction in nocturnal void frequency.

### LABELING

- FDA reserves comment; updated labeling must be submitted in SPL format.

### SAFETY UPDATE

Include:

1. Significant safety profile changes.  
2. Adverse event tabulation:
   - New safety data in original NDA format.
   - Integrated with existing data in tables.
   - Comparative tables showing adverse event frequency.
   - Separate tables for other indications.  
3. Retabulate premature discontinuation reasons using new data.  
4. Narrative summaries and forms for:
   - Patient deaths.
   - Discontinuations and serious adverse events.  
5. Describe incidence changes for less serious adverse events.  
6. Submit updated exposure data.  
7. Provide global safety and usage summary.  
8. Submit updated translations of foreign labeling.

### OTHER

- Action required within one year or application may be considered withdrawn.  
- Meeting request per May 2009 FDA guidance.

## COMPLETE RESPONSE – April 22, 2010

**To:**  
John C. Kim, R.Ph., J.D.  
Senior Director, Regulatory Affairs  

### CLINICAL/STATISTICAL

1. Trial CS029 showed efficacy only for 100 mcg dose, which caused high hyponatremia incidence.  
2. Subgroup analyses were post-hoc and not adequately controlled.  

**Action:**  
Conduct placebo-controlled trial (≥3 months) for lower dosing regimen to confirm safety and efficacy.

### CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

2. Analytical method in study CS019 not properly validated.  

**Action:**  
- Reanalyze pharmacokinetic data with validated method, or  
- Collect PK samples in future trials and validate method.

### NONCLINICAL

3. Nonclinical bridging data to listed product is inadequate due to invalidated analytical method.  

**Action:**  
- Conduct 1-month comparative toxicology study (your product vs. listed drug).

### LABELING

4. Comment reserved. Submit updated SPL labeling as necessary.

### SAFETY UPDATE

Include:

5. Changes in safety profile.  
6. Tabulate discontinuations and adverse events:
   - Present new safety data as per original format.
   - Combine and compare with original data.
   - Indications other than the proposed should be tabulated separately.  
7. Retabulate discontinuation reasons.  
8. Submit details/case reports for deaths and discontinuations.  
9. Report changes in less severe adverse events.  
10. Update exposure data (subjects/person-time).  
11. Include worldwide safety/usage estimates.  
12. Provide translations of updated foreign labeling.

### CLINICAL COMMENTS NOT RELATED TO APPROVABILITY

1. No evidence that reduced nocturnal voiding leads to clinical benefit such as fewer fractures or better quality of life.  
2. Proposed sodium monitoring (Day 4 and 28) was not evaluated in trials. Hyponatremia occurred beyond Day 28.  
3. Collect pharmacokinetic samples for exposure-response analysis in future trials and validate methods.

### OTHER

- Fully address deficiencies within one year to avoid application withdrawal.  
- Request meeting if desired under 21 CFR 314.102(d).
