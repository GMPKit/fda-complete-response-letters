Dear Dr. Kook:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated March 29, 2015, received March 30, 2015, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for INFUGEM (gemcitabine injection), 10 mg/mL.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated November 23, 2016, which constituted a complete response to our November 24, 2015, action letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

1. During recent inspections of the Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited, FEI: 3002809586, manufacturing facility for this NDA, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this NDA may be approved.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

2. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) − a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

- Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
- Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
- Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
- For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

8. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

9. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

10. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

11. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

12. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.

13. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.
