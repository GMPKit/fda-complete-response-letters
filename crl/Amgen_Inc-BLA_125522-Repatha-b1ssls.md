## INDICATIONS

BLA 125522 provides for the use of Repatha (evolocumab) for the following indications:

- **BLA 125522/Original 1**  
  Repatha is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with:
  - Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), or  
  - Clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  
  who require additional lowering of LDL-C.  
  Repatha is also indicated as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C.  
  This application only includes a 420 mg once monthly dosing regimen for the HoFH indication.

- **BLA 125522/Original 2**  
  Repatha is indicated as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C.  
  This application only includes a 420 mg every two weeks dosing regimen.

> The subject of this action letter is BLA 125522/Original 2.  
> A separate action letter will be issued for BLA 125522/Original 1.

## SUBMISSIONS

All future submissions to BLA 125522/Original 1 and BLA 125522/Original 2 should specify the BLA number and the Original number to which each submission pertains.

---

## CLINICAL

Insufficient clinical data were provided to describe the effect of the 420 mg every two week dosage in labeling for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in patients on other lipid-lowering therapies who require additional lowering of LDL-C.

Specifically, the submitted data were inadequate to describe for providers what incremental benefit, if any, is achieved by doubling the dosing frequency of 420 mg once monthly to 420 mg every two weeks.

Additional information from adequate and well-controlled study(ies) will be required to better characterize this dosing regimen.

---

## LABELING

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information website, including:

- Regulations and related guidance documents
- Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) – a checklist of 42 important format items from labeling regulations and guidances

If you revise labeling:  
- Use the SRPI checklist to ensure the PI conforms with format items in regulations and guidances  
- Include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 601.14(b)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:  
  [Structured Product Labeling (SPL)](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When responding to the deficiencies above, include a safety update containing data from all non-clinical and clinical studies regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

Requirements:

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.  
2. Incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data using same format as initial submission  
   - Present tabulations of new data combined with initial data  
   - Include tables comparing frequencies of adverse events (AEs) from original and new data  
   - Provide separate tables for AEs in indications other than proposed  
3. Present a retabulation of reasons for premature study discontinuation, noting patterns or trends.  
4. Provide:
   - Case report forms and narrative summaries for deaths or withdrawals due to AEs  
   - Narrative summaries for serious adverse events  
5. Describe any info indicating substantial change in incidence of common but less serious adverse events between datasets.  
6. Provide updated exposure information (subjects, person-time, etc.).  
7. Provide a summary of worldwide safety experience, including updated estimate of use in markets outside the U.S.  
8. Submit English translations of foreign approved labeling not already filed.
