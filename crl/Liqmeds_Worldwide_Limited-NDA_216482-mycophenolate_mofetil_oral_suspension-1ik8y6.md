Attention:  
Shehla Uraizee, PhD, RPh  
President, MA Pharmaceutical Consulting, Inc.

Dear Dr. Uraizee:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received March 8, 2022, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for mycophenolate mofetil oral suspension.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reason for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address this issue.

---

## RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY REQUIREMENTS

As described in our correspondences dated June 22 and October 17, 2022, in accordance with section 505-1 of the FDCA, we have determined that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary for mycophenolate mofetil to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of first trimester pregnancy loss and congenital malformations.

Your application cannot be approved without a REMS; therefore, you must include your proposed REMS to address this deficiency. Our communications dated June 22 and October 17, 2022, provide information about the elements your proposed REMS must include.

For administrative purposes, designate all submissions related to the proposed REMS:

**“PROPOSED REMS for NDA 216482-AMENDMENT.”**

To facilitate review of your submission:

- Submit your proposed REMS and other REMS-related materials in **Microsoft Word** format.
- Forms or website screenshots that are only available in **PDF** format may be submitted as such, but Word format is preferred.

---

## SUBMISSION OF REMS DOCUMENT IN SPL FORMAT

In addition to submitting the proposed REMS as described above, submit the REMS document in **Structured Product Labeling (SPL)** format as described in the guidance:

> Guidance for Industry, Providing Regulatory Submission in Electronic Format – Content of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies Document Using Structured Product Labeling.

For more information on submitting REMS in SPL format, please email:  
**FDAREMSwebsite@fda.hhs.gov**

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve any additional comments on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources:

- [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

Including the regulations and related guidance documents and the **Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI)** – a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances.

Your response must include **updated content of labeling** [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in SPL format as described at [FDA.gov](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Refer to the correspondence dated November 17, 2022, which addresses the proposed proprietary name. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiency(ies), include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. **Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.**
2. **Incorporate new safety data as follows:**
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

3. **Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials.** Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

4. **Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for:**
   - Each subject who died during a clinical trial
   - Subjects who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event
   - Serious adverse events

5. **Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.**

6. **Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials** (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

7. **Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug.**
   - Include an updated estimate of use for the drug marketed in other countries.

8. **Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.**
