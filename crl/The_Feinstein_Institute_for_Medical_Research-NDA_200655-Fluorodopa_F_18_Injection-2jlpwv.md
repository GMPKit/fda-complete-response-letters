**Drug:** Fluorodopa F 18 Injection  
**Sponsor:** The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research  
**Letter Type:** Complete Response

## Clinical / Statistical (2016)

Your resubmitted application contained the report of the prospectively designed **Study #17**, which aimed to evaluate Fluorodopa F 18 for:

1. Sensitivity, specificity, and clinical utility in the differential diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndromes  
2. Inter-reader reliability  
3. Quantitative correlation with Parkinson's disease diagnosis  
4. Safety by monitoring for adverse events

### Key Issues Identified

- Study #17 does not provide sufficient confirmatory evidence of effectiveness.
- PET scan performance is not adequately characterized.

Of 45 patients imaged:

- 32 were interpreted as positive (loss of dopaminergic neurons)
- 13 were interpreted as negative

Only 5 of the 13 negative cases underwent clinical follow-up; only 1 had follow-up at >1 year post-scan.

- Clinicians had access to interpretation data.
- Follow-up times for most patients were shorter than 1 year.
- Three readers agreed in 98% of cases, but reader independence and blindness are unclear.

### Recommendations

- Develop a plan including full patient follow-up immune to bias from image interpretations.
- Extend Study #17 with corrected methodology.
- Consider a meeting with the FDA to discuss a revised statistical analysis plan.

## Prescribing Information

FDA reserves comment until the application is otherwise adequate.

- Review [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov)
- Use the SRPI checklist.
- Submit updated labeling in SPL format:  
  [Structured Product Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

## Safety Update

Include the following when addressing deficiencies pursuant to [21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b)]:

1. Describe significant safety profile changes.
2. Safety data presentation:
   - Format as in original submission
   - Combine with original application data
   - Compare adverse event frequencies
   - Present separate data tables for other indications
3. Retabulate reasons for premature discontinuation
4. Submit:
   - Case report forms
   - Narrative summaries for deaths and serious adverse events
5. Highlight major changes in common AE frequency
6. Provide updated exposure data (e.g., subject count, person-time)
7. Submit summary of worldwide experience
8. Provide English translations of current foreign labeling

---

## Additional Comments

- As per amendment dated April 14, 2016, a prior approval supplement is expected if the NDA is approved.
- The chemistry information submitted August 31, 2016, was not reviewed but may be included via specific reference in resubmission.

---

## Other Instructions

- Resubmit within 1 year under **21 CFR 314.110** or request an extension.  
- Clearly mark resubmission cover letter with "RESUBMISSION."
- Partial responses are not considered complete and will not trigger review.
- A meeting or teleconference may be requested per [FDA Formal Meetings Guidance](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM153222.pdf)

The drug cannot be legally marketed without written approval.

## Clinical / Statistical (2013)

Your application lacks data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

### Study #15

- Retrospective, single-center
- No pre-specified protocol
- Used referring physician's diagnosis as reference standard (not adequate)
- Diagnostic performance claims of 100% sensitivity/specificity are not supported
- 158/185 patients had confirmed diagnosis, limiting clinical utility
- No documentation of independent, blinded image readings
- FDA site inspection confirmed inadequate records

### Study #16

- Follow-up data available for only 8 of 27 negative PET scan patients
- No documentation of follow-up confirmation
- Reasons for absence of follow-up data not provided

### Study #21 (Eshuis et al.)

- Small, exploratory
- Included only PD-diagnosed patients
- Arbitrary scan positivity threshold
- No credible specificity analysis

### Recommendations

1. Conduct adequate, well-controlled clinical trial:
   - Predefined reference standard (e.g., movement disorder specialist diagnosis ≥1 year post-scan)
   - Independent, blinded readers
   - Defined statistical plan

2. Study population:
   - Include patients for whom PD and essential tremor differentiation is unclear
   - Exclude patients with MSA, PSP features, ≥5 years clinical history, or drugs affecting dopaminergic uptake

3. Good Clinical Practice (GCP) compliance required

---

## GCP Inspection Findings

- No prospective protocol or case report forms used
- Lacked source records and documentation of clinical assessments
- PET scans:
  - Not interpreted by three blinded readers
  - No documentation of carbidopa pre-medication in 18 cases
  - Missing data on adverse events (1 early termination undocumented)

---

## Product Quality

**Outstanding Issues (from letters dated 12/28/2012, 5/31/2013, 7/2/2013):**

   - Add test method and acceptance criteria
   - Provide experimental and characterization data

2. Update drug product specs (S.3.2.P.5.1):
   - Submit in tabular format
   - Align methods and validation (S.3.2.P.5.2)

3. Validation data for chemical and chiral purity (e.g., accuracy, precision) not in August 21, 2013 submission
