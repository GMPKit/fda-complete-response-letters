### PRODUCT QUALITY

#### Drug Product

Adhesion of the transdermal system is a critical factor for product safety and efficacy. Major quality issues persist, including:

- Non-comparable in-process adhesion data between clinical and commercial-scale intermediates.
- High frequency of invalid results.
- Lack of validated “Part Tack” test with definitive acceptance criteria.
- Current in vitro adhesion test (TP074) is subjective, variable, and provides uninterpretable data.

##### Identified Deficiencies:

1. In-process tack and adhesion tests are not adequate to ensure commercial-scale product quality.
2. The finished product specification does not adequately ensure quality related to tack and adhesion.

#### Facility Inspections

3. Inspection of Corium International Inc. revealed objectionable conditions. Information was relayed to the facility after inspection.

---

### CLINICAL

In Study ATI-CL23:

- 11.3% of patches showed <75% adhesion.
- Over 50% of subjects reported at least one full detachment.
- High Pearl Index: 5.83 (95% CI 4.45–7.21).
- High subject discontinuation rates (>50%).
- Unscheduled bleeding during treatment (>40%).

Efficacy appears compromised due to:

- Inadequate adhesion.
- Tolerability issues.
- Delays in applying patches.
- High withdrawal/dropout rates.

---

### Summary Conclusion

Due to the adhesion deficiencies and clinical performance issues, including uncertain efficacy and safety, the application is not approvable in its current form.

---

### Recommendations to Address the Deficiencies

#### Drug Product

1. Investigate root cause(s) of in vivo adhesion issues — formulation design or other factors.
2. Develop and validate in-process tests for tack and adhesion. Justify specification ranges.
3. Develop and validate finished product release and stability tests for tack and adhesion.

#### Facility Inspections

4. Resolve all objectionable conditions at Corium International Inc. (FEI 3003693015).

#### Clinical

5. Determine if efficacy/safety are compromised by formulation or other factors. If needed, redesign the transdermal system and conduct a new U.S. trial.

### PREA REQUIREMENTS

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), a pediatric study plan (iPSP) must be submitted within 60 days of an End-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting. The iPSP must include:

- Study objectives and design.
- Age groups, endpoints, statistical approach.
- Deferral/waiver requests.
- Supporting documentation.
- FDA or other regulatory negotiated plans.

Submit in PDF and Word format. Failure to include an agreed iPSP may result in a Refuse to File action. Guidance available at:  
[Draft Guidance: Pediatric Study Plans](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM360507.pdf)

### PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

The proposed labeling will be reviewed when the application is adequate. Review SRPI checklist during revision:  
[Structured Product Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

### PROPRIETARY NAME

The proposed name "Twirla" was found acceptable pending application approval. Resubmit the name upon addressing deficiencies.

---

### SAFETY UPDATE

Include a safety update as per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b):

1. Significant changes/findings in safety.
2. New adverse events:
   - Present data using original NDA format.
   - Combine with original data.
   - Compare frequencies.
   - Provide tables for non-proposed indications separately.
3. Retabulate trial drop-out reasons.
4. Provide narrative summaries for deaths/adverse events and related case report forms.
5. Assess changes in common but less serious adverse events.
6. Update subject exposure data.
7. Summarize global usage and safety.
8. Submit English translations of foreign approved labeling previously unsubmitted.

---

### OTHER

You must resubmit or take regulatory action within one year under 21 CFR 314.110. If no action is taken, the application may be considered withdrawn under 21 CFR 314.65.

A resubmission must:

- Address all deficiencies.
- Be marked “RESUBMISSION” in the cover letter.
- Not be a partial response.

Meeting requests are encouraged. Reference guidance:

## Additional Correspondence

### NDA 204017 – Acknowledge Incomplete Response  
**To:**  
Gracelyn Deebo  
Sr. Vice President, Regulatory Affairs  
Submitted: June 24, 2013

### Summary

FDA does not consider your submission a complete response. Review clock will not begin.

#### Clinical

Original Phase 3 studies inadequately demonstrated efficacy. FDA noted:

- Low completion rates.
- Poor follow-up and data collection.
- A new Phase 3 trial is required before approval.

#### CMC

Rejected proposals included:

- Absence of identifying label on product.
- Cold flow and excipient assay specifications.
- Need for comprehensive evaluation of penetration enhancers and excipient interactions.

**Recommendation:** FDA strongly recommends requesting a meeting to discuss a viable path forward.

### NDA 204017 – Complete Response (Feb 13, 2013)

**To:**  
Agile Therapeutics, Inc.  
Attention: Marie Foegh, M.D.

#### Clinical Deficiencies

1. Phase 3 studies failed to demonstrate acceptable efficacy:
   - ATI-CL12: Pearl Index 7.50 (Upper CI: 9.97)
   - ATI-CL13: Pearl Index 8.19 (Upper CI: 16.19)

FDA requires:

- A new Phase 3 study in U.S. population.
- Acceptable Pearl Index demonstrated over 13 cycles.
- Improved study conduct and compliance evaluations.

#### Product Quality Deficiencies

1. Inadequate controls for etching.
2. Incomplete specification (cold flow/shear tests missing).
3. Excipient specification limits unjustified.
4. Product lacks identifying label per FDA policy.
5. Impurities not characterized.
6. Post-approval stability protocol deficient.
7. Inadequate DMF referenced (requires update).
8. No performance comparison between clinical and commercial manufacturing equipment.

#### Clinical Study Recommendations

- Accrue representative U.S. population.
- Track patch site performance.
- Improve subject compliance and training.
- Accurate pregnancy outcome tracking and pregnancy assessments.

#### CMC Notes

- Separate close examination of adhesion data, etching, excipient analysis.
- Validation concerns for TP011, TP078, TP074, AM79 methods.

#### Biopharmaceutics

- Adjust in vitro criterion for 72-hour drug release.

#### Clinical Pharmacology

- Address whether prior product quality affected studies.
- Analyze carry-over in key studies (ATI-CL14, ATI-CL15, ATI-CL16).

#### Labeling

Comments reserved until application is adequate.
