Dear Mr. D’Angelo:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received May 31, 2013, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for **Avaclyr (acyclovir ophthalmic ointment) 3%**.

### NDA 202408  
### COMPLETE RESPONSE  

**Fera Pharmaceuticals, LLC**  
Attention: John D’Angelo, M.S., R.Ph.  
Vice President Regulatory Affairs  
134 Birch Hill Road  
Locust Valley, NY 11560  

Dear Mr. D’Angelo:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated May 31, 2013, received May 31, 2013, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for **Avaclyr (acyclovir ophthalmic ointment) 3.0%**.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated December 24, 2015, constituting a complete response to our March 31, 2014, action letter, and your amendment dated June 22, 2016.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We describe our reason for this action below and provide recommendations where possible.

### Quality and Performance Tests / In Vitro Release Testing

1. The in vitro release testing (IVRT) method is inadequately validated.  
   - Provide the investigational report and description of the improved final method.  
   - Submit a full validation report of the final IVRT method, demonstrating sensitivity to drug concentration differences.  
   - Include solubility data and intrinsic dissolution rate (USP <1087>) for acyclovir from your product, Zovirax, and comparable formulations. Compare to known polymorph characteristics.

### Acyclovir Polymorphisms

2. Clarify the polymorphic differences between your product and the currently marketed UK version of Zovirax.

### Other Options

Alternatively, a controlled clinical trial using Avaclyr may be conducted. We encourage a meeting with the division to discuss.

---

### LABELING

Comments on proposed labeling are deferred until the application is otherwise adequate. Ensure compliance with PLR requirements and SRPI checklist.

Submit updated content of labeling in SPL format per FDA guidance:  
[Structured Product Labeling (FDA)](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

### PROPRIETARY NAME

Refer to correspondence dated April 8, 2016. The name "Avaclyr" is considered acceptable pending application approval. Resubmit name upon addressing deficiencies.

---

### SAFETY UPDATE

Submit a safety update consistent with 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b), including:

1. Description of significant safety findings  
2. Integration of new safety data in NDA format, with tabulated comparisons  
3. Retabulated trial discontinuation reasons  
4. Case report forms for serious adverse events  
5. Identification of incidence changes in less-serious adverse events  
6. Subject exposure data (subject count and person-time)  
7. Global postmarketing safety summary  
8. Foreign labeling translations (if not previously submitted)

---

### OTHER

A complete response must be submitted within one year per 21 CFR 314.110. The FDA may consider the application withdrawn per 21 CFR 314.65 if not addressed.

You may request a meeting with FDA per guidance:  
“Formal Meetings Between FDA and Sponsors or Applicants,” May 2009  
[Formal Meetings Guidance PDF](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM153222.pdf)

This drug may not be marketed until written approval is granted.

If you have any questions, contact **Lois Almoza, M.S.**, Regulatory Project Manager, at (301) 796-1600.

Attention: John D’Angelo, M.S., R.Ph.  
Vice President, Regulatory Affairs  
134 Birch Hill Road  
Locust Valley, NY 11560  

Dear Mr. D’Angelo:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated May 31, 2013, received May 31, 2013, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for **Avaclyr (acyclovir ophthalmic ointment) 3.0%**.

We acknowledge receipt of the following amendments:

- June 7, 2013 (2)
- June 13, 2013
- July 2, 2013
- July 24, 2013
- August 27, 2013
- August 30, 2013

- March 12, 2014
- March 18, 2014
- March 19, 2014
- March 25, 2014 (2)

We have completed our review and cannot approve the application in its current form.

### Scientific Bridge

You have not established an adequate scientific bridge between your formulation and those used in referenced clinical trials.

Recommendations:

- Compare 3 lots of Fera’s ointment with 3 lots (if available) of Zovirax  
- Account for variability in product quality attributes of the RLD

---

### Petrolatum

1. White Petrolatum USP criteria are broad; additional physicochemical characterization is required (melting point, viscosity, specific gravity, etc.).

### Viscosity

2. Provide a rheological evaluation at various shear rates given the non-Newtonian flow behavior of the ointment.

### Quality and Performance Tests

3. Apply and validate applicable USP methods:

   - <741> Melting Temperature  
   - <791> pH  
   - <841> Specific Gravity  
   - <771> Ophthalmic Ointments  
   - <1724> Drug Release

   IVRT should demonstrate:

   - Reproducibility  
   - Discriminatory power  
   - Sensitivity to formulation differences (e.g., 2%, 3%, and 4% concentrations)

   Receptor solution in IVRT should reasonably simulate artificial tears with proper solubility.

---

### Acyclovir Particle Size

Provide D10, D50, and D90 data comparing the RLD and your formulation to confirm ophthalmic suitability.

### Acyclovir Polymorphisms

Identify polymorphic forms present in Zovirax and your formulation. Demonstrate pharmaceutical equivalence on this basis.

If a scientific bridge cannot be established, consider an alternative development plan such as a controlled clinical trial.

---

### LABELING

Review remains deferred; submit updated SPL-format labeling following the application’s adequacy.

### SAFETY UPDATE

Follow previously outlined guidelines in your comprehensive safety update submission.

---

### OTHER

Submit a full response within one year as outlined under 21 CFR 314.110. Request an extension if needed.

Meeting or teleconference requests are permissible under 21 CFR 314.102(d). For reference:  
[Formal Meetings Guidance PDF](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM153222.pdf)

No marketing is permitted until formal written FDA approval is received.
