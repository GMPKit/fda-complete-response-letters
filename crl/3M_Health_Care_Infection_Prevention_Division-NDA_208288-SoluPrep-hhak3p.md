# COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER

## NONCLINICAL

- The proposed impurity specifications exceed the qualification threshold per ICH Q3B(R2).
- The dermal rabbit study (#16-014) lacks sufficient tissue battery for systemic toxicity.
- Doses in the rabbit study may not support impurity specifications when considering the 26 mL applicator.
- Suggested alternatives include:
  - Clinical pharmacokinetic data and animal toxicokinetic data
  - Data from a Maximal Use Trial (MUsT)
- Franz Cell assay data is insufficient.
- Consider aligning impurity specifications with a relevant approved product.
- For extended single dose studies:
  - One group sacrificed post-dose, another on Day 14
  - Design must reflect expected human clinical use
  - Assess both local/systemic effects across a full tissue battery
  - Justify full study protocol

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When responding to deficiencies, include an update per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b):

1. Describe significant changes/findings in safety profile.
2. Include new safety data:
   - Present in same format as original submission
   - Tabulate new and combined data
   - Provide adverse event frequency comparisons
   - Present tables for other indications separately
3. Retabulate reasons for trial discontinuation.
4. Provide CRFs and narratives for deaths and SAEs.
5. Note any changes in common adverse event incidence.
6. Update exposure data (subjects, person time).
7. Provide global safety summary with usage estimates.
8. Include translations of previously unsubmitted foreign labeling.

---

## CHEMISTRY, MANUFACTURING AND CONTROLS

- Tentative impurity specifications accepted as qualification remains inadequate.

---

## OTHER

- Must resubmit or take alternate actions under 21 CFR 314.110 within one year.
- Resubmission must address all deficiencies.
- Start of new review cycle requires full response.
- Meetings may be requested per FDA guidance.
- Product cannot be marketed before formal approval.

## CLINICAL

### 1. Efficacy

- Replicative efficacy not shown for inguinal site in pivotal Study EM-05-013260.
- Study EM-05-012760 passed all endpoints; Study EM-05-013260 did not.
- Conduct a repeat inguinal region study meeting pre-specified endpoints.

### 2. Financial Disclosure

- Disclosure missing for 11/20 subinvestigators in EM-05-012760.
- One subinvestigator missing disclosure in EM-05-013260.
- Describe:
   - Disclosure collection efforts before/after trials
   - Each subinvestigator's involvement and potential bias
   - Sensitivity analyses excluding subjects from undisclosed subinvestigators
   - Provide datasets identifying subinvestigator per subject (`usubjid`)
   - List of subinvestigators per trial with indication of missing data

---

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

- Inadequate literature references for human pharmacokinetics of isopropyl alcohol and CHG/IPA.
- Options:
   - Use validated literature for skin prep scenarios comparable to the 26 mL product
   - Rely on FDA safety findings for listed drugs
   - Conduct a Maximal Use PK study with the to-be-marketed formulation

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

- Proposed impurity limits exceed ICH thresholds (<1%).
- Impurities exceed 1.0% at unspecified months; thus, no expiry date can be granted.
- Submit full qualification studies to justify expiry dating.

---

## MICROBIOLOGY

1. **CCIT Validation:**
   - Detection rate for defects ≥50μm was ~33% or lower.
   - No defect detection in 26 mL ampules.
   - Detection threshold does not support microbial ingress prevention.
   - Provide data from a validated microbial ingress-capable method.

2. **Applicator Pouch:**
   - Provide CCIT results and method validation for pouch.

3. **Production Monitoring:**
   - Clarify if production monitoring for 26 mL is same as 10.5 mL during scale-up.

4. **Requalification Schedule:**
   - Revise SOP to reflect acceptable procedures.

5. **Bioburden Samples:**
   - Identify sources (lot numbers) of 46 samples.
   - Clarify stability program samples and respective testing.

6. **Bioburden Method (STP00036):**
   - Specify microorganism names
   - Detail neutralization steps or rinse volumes
   - Provide validation data confirming recovery capability

7. **Validation Data Issues:**
   - Clarify procedural implementation from Protocol 201404182
   - Describe Protocol 201401236 relation to current method
   - Explain missing results for 5 of 8 samples

8. **Sterility Testing:**
   - Validate the method used for ampoules and clarify if lot release testing uses a validated method.
   - Backup methods not acceptable for release testing.
   - Revise specs to include validated sterility method.

9. **Stability Program:**
   - Proposal to use CCIT instead of sterility testing is acceptable.
   - Provide validated CCIT data in specifications.

10. **Applicator Sterility:**
    - Incorporate CCIT or sterility testing into the stability protocol of applicator or packaging.

## PROPRIETARY NAME

- Proprietary name *SoluPrep™* was previously found acceptable (Oct 19, 2015).
- Resubmit name when responding to deficiencies.

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS (Non-Approvability)

### CLINICAL

1. For safety labeling based on literature:
   - Specify article per claim
   - Summarize supporting articles

2. Address drape adhesion study designs and real-world alignment.

3. Mitigation of bias:
   - Address open-label study designs and sponsor/investigator overlap

4. Submit datasets for:
   - Listings 16.2.8.1 & 16.2.8.2 from EM-05-013260
   - EM-05-012680 adverse events by `usubjid`

5. For protocol submitted in Amendment 23 (EM-05-012680):
   - Identify exact protocol page references for dwell time change

---

## OTHER

- Resubmit or act under 21 CFR 314.110 within 1 year.
- Must address all deficiencies; partial submissions not accepted.
- Request pre-approval meetings via appropriate FDA guidance.
