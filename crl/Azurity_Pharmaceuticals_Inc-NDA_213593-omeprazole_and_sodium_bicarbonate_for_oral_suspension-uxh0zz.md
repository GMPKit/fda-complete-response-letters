### COMPLETE RESPONSE

**Recipient:**  
Azurity Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Attention: Michael C. Beckloff  
Chief Development Officer

Overland Park, KS 66210

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated March 30, 2020, received March 30, 2020, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate for oral suspension.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated December 15, 2020 and January 8, 2021, which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

Based on our review of the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information provided in the original submission and reviewed amendments, we find that the proposed control strategy is insufficient to assure the identity, strength, purity, quality, and bioavailability of the drug product as required by 21 CFR 314.50.

### (1) Sodium Bicarbonate Strength

- The assay method for sodium bicarbonate may underestimate levels at the high end and overestimate at the low end.
- There are no data to confirm the diluent and suspension meet assay acceptance (90.0% to 110.0% LC) at release, shelf life, or during 30-day in-use period.

### (2) Omeprazole Strength and Uniformity

- Procedure MET-CDM-000025 differs from the one used in registration stability studies (SN 0001).
- The validation report does not cover the alternate method.
- No comparability shown between methods.

### (3) In-Process Control

- No in-process control is established for critical parameters.

---

## TO ADDRESS THESE DEFICIENCIES

1. Revise specifications for the diluent and the constituted oral suspension to include tests, procedures, and acceptance criteria for sodium bicarbonate.
2. Provide evidence or revise analytical methods to reduce variability in bicarbonate recovery.
3. Provide validation reports and method comparability data for omeprazole assay methods.
4. Submit batch release and minimum six-month stability data for all commercial configurations (90 mL, 150 mL, 300 mL).
5. Manufacture per revised process, submit batch record, and update relevant sections.
6. Establish in-process controls:
   - Sampling plan
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Updated test results in section 3.3.P.3.4

---

## CLINICAL

- Data are insufficient to support the proposed indication:  
  **"Reduction of risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients."**

- Provide adequate support for nasogastric and orogastric administration.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment until the application is otherwise adequate.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS  
*(Not approvability issues)*

   - Submit Method Development Report No. 19-012-80800-R01
   - Confirm test conditions do not reduce particle size
   - Provide PSD data for constituted suspension

2. Confirm:
   - Target fill weights for omeprazole bottle
   - Target fill volumes for diluent bottle
   - Justifications supporting final 2 mg/mL omeprazole and 84 mg/mL sodium bicarbonate for 90, 150, and 300 mL configurations
