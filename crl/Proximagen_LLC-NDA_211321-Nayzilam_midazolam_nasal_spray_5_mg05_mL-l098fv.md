Attention: Encarnacion Suarez, PharmD  
Director, Global Regulatory Affairs  
505 Waterford Park, Highway 169 North, Suite 850  
Plymouth, MN 55441  

Dear Dr. Suarez,

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated May 27, 2018, received May 29, 2018, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Nayzilam (midazolam) nasal spray 5 mg/0.5 mL.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## QUALITY SYSTEM

We refer to our November 13, 2018, letter which identified Quality System deficiencies and requested additional information. The deficiencies, identified in our November 13, 2018, letter, assumed that Proximagen was the applicant for NDA 211321, and that was the contract manufacturer. As such, the Quality System deficiencies were limited to these firms.

Based on your March 8, 2019, Response to the March 5, 2019, FDA-483 that FDA issued to you, it appears that UCBBioPharma SPRL (UCB) has purchased this NDA and is integrally involved in several aspects of the Quality System at your firm. You will need to update your responses to FDA’s November 8, 2019, Quality System deficiencies to additionally identify how the manufacturer UCB integrates into the Quality System established at your firm.

### 1. Management Responsibility (21 CFR 820.20)

You have not adequately addressed the requirements for 21 CFR 820.20. Please describe the specific management control responsibilities at each facility associated with the medical device constituent of this combination product. To date, we are aware that the only facilities with potential management control responsibilities are Proximagen and UCB.

Provide:

- A summary of how your firm’s management has established responsibility to assure that the combination product is manufactured in compliance with all applicable CGMP requirements (see 21 CFR Part 4).
- A description of the functions and responsibility of each facility involved in the manufacturing of the combination product.

### 2. Design Controls (21 CFR 820.30)

You have not adequately addressed the requirements for 21 CFR 820.30. Please:

- Explain the extent to which UCB is involved in the design control process.
- Provide the procedures established at UCB that demonstrate how design controls are implemented. This should include:
  - Design and development planning
  - Design input
  - Design output
  - Design review
  - Design verification
  - Design validation
  - Design transfer
  - Design changes
  - Design history file

### 3. Purchasing Controls (21 CFR 820.50)

You have not adequately addressed the requirements for 21 CFR 820.50. Please provide:

- Summary of procedure(s) at UCB for purchasing controls, including how responsibilities are delineated across Proximagen and UCB.

Include:

a. Supplier evaluation process and how you determine the type and extent of control over suppliers  
b. Record maintenance of acceptable suppliers and the purchasing data approval process  
c. Balance of purchasing assessments and receiving acceptance to ensure products/services are acceptable for intended use

Also explain how procedures ensure that changes made by contractors/suppliers will not affect the final combination product, including the application of purchasing controls to the suppliers/contractors used in the manufacturing (e.g., through supplier agreements).

### 4. Corrective and Preventive Actions (21 CFR 820.100)

You have not adequately addressed the requirement for 21 CFR 820.100. Specifically, it appears that UCB is integrated into the overall Quality System at your firm.

Please summarize the procedure(s) for your firm’s CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action) System, including delineation of facility responsibilities.

The CAPA system should require:

- Identification of sources of quality data and analysis to identify existing and potential causes of nonconforming practices/products  
- Investigation of nonconformities and their causes  
- Identification and implementation of corrective and preventive actions  
- Verification or validation of actions taken

### 5. Production Flow Diagram

Please provide a production flow diagram that identifies the steps involved in the manufacture of the finished combination product under review.

Ensure the diagram:

- Identifies which facility is responsible for each step  
- Displays important aspects of the production process

### 6. Acceptance Activities

Please explain how UCB will integrate into the processes for controlling the manufacturing of the combination product through:

- Receiving or incoming activities  
- In-process activities  
- Final acceptance activities

Specify:

- Which firm performs acceptance activities for receiving of components/materials  
- In-process testing during manufacturing/assembly  
- Final release of the combination product  
- Acceptance/rejection criteria for:
  - Receiving components/materials  
  - In-process tests  
  - Finished product release
