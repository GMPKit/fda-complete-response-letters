Dear Mr. Macalush,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated March 12, 2020, received March 12, 2020, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Fexinidazole tablets, 600 mg.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reason for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address the issue.

---

On November 9, 2020, you notified us that you will not be able to submit revised labeling during this review cycle. Therefore, an agreement could not be reached regarding product labeling.  

To address this deficiency, submit draft labeling that addresses our proposed revisions to the labeling communicated to you via email on November 4, 2020.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Prior to resubmitting the labeling:

- Use the SRPI checklist to correct any formatting errors to ensure conformance with the format items in regulations and guidances.
- Submit updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in Structured Product Labeling (SPL) format as described at [FDA.gov](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).
- Provide:
  - A highlighted or marked-up copy that shows all changes
  - A clean Word version
  - Annotations supporting any proposed changes in the marked-up copy

Your proposed Prescribing Information (PI) must conform to the content and format regulations found at:

- 21 CFR 201.56(a) and (d)

## SAFETY UPDATE

When responding to the above deficiency, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

Include:

1. Detailed description of any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. Incorporation of new safety data:
   - Present new safety data using same format as original submission.
   - Combine new and original data in tabulations.
   - Include comparative tables of adverse event frequencies.
   - For other indications, provide separate tables for adverse event frequencies.
3. Retabulation of reasons for premature trial discontinuation, including new trial drop-outs. Describe new trends or patterns.

   - All serious adverse events
5. Description of any substantial changes in incidence of common but less serious adverse events.
6. Updated exposure information (e.g., number of subjects, person-time) for clinical studies/trials.

8. English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.
