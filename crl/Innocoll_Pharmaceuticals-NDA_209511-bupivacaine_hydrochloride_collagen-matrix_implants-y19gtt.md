Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received October 31, 2016, our Refuse to File letter dated December 23, 2016, your resubmission dated February 2, 2018, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), for bupivacaine hydrochloride collagen-matrix implants, 100 mg per implant.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## NONCLINICAL

1. **Systemic Safety Characterization**  
   - The systemic safety of bupivacaine via this formulation is not adequately characterized. Your product shows an AUC(0-last) twice that of the referenced product. Rat toxicology data do not reflect human exposure levels.

   **To address this deficiency:**  
   - Conduct adequate toxicology studies in two species covering the proposed human exposures (AUC and Cmax) or provide clinical data supporting the proposed exposure.

2. **In Vivo Micronucleus Assay**  
   - No valid in vivo micronucleus assay provided. The high dose did not produce frank toxicity.

   **To address this deficiency:**  
   - Repeat the assay using doses causing frank toxicity per ICH S2(R1):  
     [ICH S2(R1) Guidance Document](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM074931.pdf)

3. **Extractables/Leachables Evaluation**  
   - Inadequate extractables/leachables evaluation for container closure system safety.

   **To address this deficiency:**  
   - Identify detected compounds in extraction studies. Check drug product for any extractable ≥ mcg/day.  
   - Provide toxicological risk assessment for any leachable compound ≥ mcg/day.

4. **Specification Justification**  
   - Insufficient justification provided for a specified impurity in the formulation.

   **To address this deficiency:**  
   - Either reduce the specification to NMT a defined mcg/day level  
   - Or justify with a toxicological risk assessment per ICH M7(R1):  
     [ICH M7(R1) Guidance Document](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM347725.pdf)

## PRODUCT QUALITY

5. **Leachables Assessment Incomplete**  
   - No provided analytical method; extractables-leachables correlation unavailable.

   **To address this deficiency:**  
   a. Identify target leachables from primary and secondary packaging extractables.  
   b. Develop detection methods applicable to the drug product.  
   c. Test 3 drug product batches at multiple time-points, especially with ink-labeled blisters.

   Refer to USP <1663> and <1664> for more information.

   - Use SRPI checklist.  
   - Submit updated labeling in SPL format per 21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i):  
     [Structured Product Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

## SAFETY UPDATE

Include a safety update as per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b) with your response, including:

1. Interpretation of new safety data.  
2. Data on AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations:  
   - Present in original table format  
   - Combine with prior data  
   - Frequency tables for AEs and separate tables by indications  

3. Updated trial discontinuation reasons.  
4. Case report forms/narratives for deaths and SAEs.  
5. Trends in common, less serious AEs.  
6. Updated exposure info (subjects, person-time).  
7. Global safety experience and foreign labeling (with translations).

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

- The indication “for placement into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia following …” lacks clinical support.
- Accepted indication may be limited only to tested surgical populations proven safe and effective.
