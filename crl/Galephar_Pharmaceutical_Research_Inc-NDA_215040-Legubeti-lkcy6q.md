# CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH

## APPLICATION NUMBER:
NDA 215040  
Original Submission: 215040Orig1s000

## OTHER ACTION LETTERS

**To:**  
Galephar Pharmaceutical Research Inc.  
Attention: Britta Martinez  
Director Regulatory Affairs  
Carr 925 Km 6.1 Bo Junquito  
HC-04 Box 4540  
Humacao, PR 00791  

Dear Ms. Martinez,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received July 7, 2022, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Legubeti (acetylcysteine) for oral solution.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

1. You have not provided data to demonstrate the tolerability of Legubeti, the lysine salt of acetylcysteine, for the full range of loading and maintenance doses for patients with all body weights proposed in labeling.  
   - Both lysine and acetylcysteine have an unpleasant taste, and acetylcysteine has an unpleasant odor that may affect the tolerability of oral ingestion.  
   - The data to address the effect of the lysine on the palatability of Legubeti is inadequate.  
   - The completed relative bioavailability study with Legubeti and the acetylcysteine oral solution (a reference standard as a substitute for the relied-upon listed drug) conducted with 1 gm of acetylcysteine is not adequate to address palatability because most patients will receive higher doses (up to 15 gm) based on the proposed weight-based dosage.  
   - Because timely administration of acetylcysteine is essential to mitigate toxicity from acetaminophen overdose, uncertainty remains as to whether ingestion of the full Legubeti dose can be administered, either due to inadequate palatability or inadequate tolerability.  
   - Consequently, these uncertainties place patients at increased risk of acetaminophen-induced toxicity.  
   - **To resolve this deficiency:** Conduct palatability and tolerability studies at clinically relevant dose(s). The proposed clinical investigation should include a patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instrument that is fit-for-purpose. Before embarking on these studies, we recommend reaching agreement with the Division of Clinical Outcomes Assessment (DCOA) regarding your PRO to ensure it is valid.

2. You have not provided adequate information to support the safety of L-lysine administration to pediatric patients weighing down to 1 kg.  
   - This information is needed to inform the benefit-risk assessment of this product in the pediatric population.  
   - The maximum daily amount of L-lysine expected to be administered with Legubeti ranges from 502.6 mg/kg/day (including the loading dose on the first day) to 313 mg/kg/day (after completion of the maintenance doses).  
   - This amount exceeds the estimated daily intake of L-lysine in enterally fed term neonates.  
   - **To resolve this deficiency:** Provide additional information (e.g., published literature or a study) to justify the safety of the L-lysine exposure in pediatric patients down to 1 kg, for the proposed indication.

---

## REGULATORY

3. The relied-upon listed drug for this 505(b)(2) application is Mucomyst. You cited the Cetylev prescribing information in order to comply with the Physician Labeling Rule (PLR) and the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR).  
   - It is acceptable to refer to the Cetylev label for the purpose of PLR and PLLR formatting.  
   - However, if you are relying on FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for Cetylev (or another listed drug) concerning Lactation, Pregnancy, and Females and Males of Reproductive Potential information, you must comply with the legal/regulatory requirements for such reliance (e.g., establishing a scientific bridge, patent certification).  
   - Alternatively, you may rely on non-product-specific published literature to comply with PLLR.  
   - **To resolve this deficiency:**  
     1. Cite and provide original publications corroborating the proposed labeling language that are not based on FDA’s finding of a listed drug (including the labeling of a listed drug); or  
     2. Cite reliance on Cetylev and comply with the legal/regulatory requirements for such reliance.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the following websites:

- [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)  
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

Including regulations and guidance documents such as the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) – a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure conformity. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

- [Structured Product Labeling at FDA](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Please refer to correspondence dated December 29, 2022, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Legubeti.

This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

Include:

1. Description of any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.  
2. For discontinued subjects due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events:  
   - Present new safety data in the same format as original submission.  
   - Tabulate new safety data combined with the original application data.  
   - Include comparative tables showing frequencies of adverse events.  
   - Provide separate tables for other indications.  
3. Retabulated reasons for premature trial discontinuation including newly completed trials; describe new trends or patterns.  
4. Case report forms and narrative summaries:  
   - For each subject who died or discontinued due to adverse events.  
   - For all serious adverse events.  
5. Any new information suggesting a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events.  
6. Updated exposure details (e.g., number of subjects, person time).  
7. Summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug, including:  
   - Updated use estimates for drug marketed in other countries.  
8. English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

- Consistent with USP nomenclature, we recommend that the dosage form be described as “for oral solution” instead of “powder for oral solution”.  
- Provide a comprehensive summary of clinical pharmacology information for N-acetylcysteine and L-Lysine from published literature with original articles.

---

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions under 21 CFR 314.110. If no action is taken, your application may be considered withdrawn under 21 CFR 314.65. You may also request an extension of time.

A resubmission must:

- Fully address all deficiencies.  
- Be clearly marked with "RESUBMISSION" in large, bold type at the beginning of the cover letter.  
- Explicitly state the resubmission addresses all deficiencies.

Partial responses will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference to discuss necessary actions. Submit your meeting request per the draft guidance:  
*Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products*.
