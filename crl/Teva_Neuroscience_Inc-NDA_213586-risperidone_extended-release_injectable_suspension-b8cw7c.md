## OTHER ACTION LETTERS

### NDA 213586 — COMPLETE RESPONSE  
Teva Neuroscience, Inc.  
Attention: Levana Volovsky  
Director, Regulatory Affairs  
145 Brandywine Parkway  
West Chester, PA 19380  

Dear Ms. Volovsky,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received June 17, 2021, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for risperidone extended-release injectable suspension.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

Our review identified investigational product (IP) dosing errors including several instances of:

- Patients receiving IP doses higher than the assigned dose  
- Lack of documentation of IP administration  
- Dually and triply enrolled patients  

Because of these data quality issues, the dosing data from Study TV-46000-CNS-30072 and Study TV-46000-CNS-30078 cannot be relied upon. Given the differences in the PK profile between the listed drug and TV-46000 and the potential for trough levels to lead to relapse in patients, it is important to understand what IP doses patients actually received.

The application does not contain adequate evidence for the Agency to make an efficacy finding for this new formulation because the doses of IP that provided benefit to patients could not be verified and thus cannot be described in the product label. In addition, the exposure-response relationship of the safety findings could not be evaluated.

### To resolve these deficiencies:

- Submit results of an independent third-party audit or post-study monitoring (by sponsor/CRO) for all sites and all subjects:
  - Establish the extent of IP dosing errors
  - Assess lack of IP dose documentation
  - Determine what study data can be relied upon for regulatory decision making
- Submit relevant updated analyses and dosing datasets based on the audit findings

Alternatively, submit a new adequate and well-controlled clinical efficacy and safety study.

## LABELING ISSUES

### Syringe Labels

| Identified Issue | Rationale for Concern | Recommendation |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| 1. "Rx Only" statement is not on the labels | Required on the label | Add the "Rx Only" statement |
| 2. Expiration date format is not specified | Clear expiration date format minimizes confusion and risk for deteriorated drug medication errors | Specify expiration date format: |
| | | - Human-readable expiration date to include year, month, and non-zero day |
| | | - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD` (for numeric) or `YYYY-MMM-DD` (for alpha) |
| | | - If space limited: `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY-MMM` |
| | | - Use slash or hyphen to separate portions |
| 3. Route of administration is not on the labels | Should be on the labels | Add the route of administration |

### Carton Labeling

| Identified Issue | Rationale for Concern | Recommendation |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 1. No statement of dosage on carton | Dosage guidance should be present | Add a statement such as “Recommended Dosage: See Prescribing Information” |
| 2. Human-readable/machine-readable product identifier unclear | Required for identification and tracing | Clarify whether 2D matrix barcode is present; if not, consult FDA Guidance for Industry: [Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act](https://www.fda.gov/media/116304/download) |
| 3. Expiration date format not specified | Prevents confusion and medication errors | Same recommendations as syringe label |
| 4. Strength missing from side panel (e.g., 50 mg/0.14 mL) | Strength is identifying information | Add strength to side panel |
| 5. Lacks statement that product is for healthcare professional administration | Required statement missing | Add “For administration by a healthcare professional” to principal display panel |
