Attention: Encarnacion Suarez, PharmD  
Director, Global Regulatory Affairs  
505 Waterford Park, Highway 169 North, Suite 850  
Plymouth, MN 55441  

Dear Dr. Suarez:  

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated May 27, 2018, received May 29, 2018, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Nayzilam (midazolam) nasal spray 5 mg/0.5 mL.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## QUALITY SYSTEM

We refer to our November 13, 2018, letter which identified Quality System deficiencies and requested additional information. The deficiencies, identified in our November 13, 2018, letter, assumed that Proximagen was the applicant for NDA 211321, and that was the contract manufacturer. As such, the Quality System deficiencies were limited to these firms.

Based on your March 8, 2019, Response to the March 5, 2019, FDA-483 that FDA issued to you, it appears that UCBBioPharma SPRL (UCB) has purchased this NDA and is integrally involved in several aspects of the Quality System at your firm. You will need to update your responses to FDA’s November 8, 2019, Quality System deficiencies to additionally identify how the manufacturer UCB integrates into the Quality System established at your firm.

1. You have not adequately addressed the requirements for **21 CFR 820.20, Management Responsibility**.  
   Please describe the specific management control responsibilities at each facility associated with the medical device constituent of this combination product.  
   To date, we are aware that the only facilities with potential management control responsibilities are Proximagen and UCB.  
   Please provide a summary of how your firm’s management has established responsibility to assure that the combination product is manufactured in compliance with all applicable CGMP requirements (see 21 CFR Part 4).  
   Also, provide a description of the functions and responsibility of each facility involved in the manufacturing of the combination product.

2. You have not adequately addressed the requirements for **21 CFR 820.30, Design Controls**.  
   Please explain the extent to which UCB is involved in the design control process.  
   You will need to specifically provide the procedures established at UCB to demonstrate how design controls are implemented at UCB; this includes how requirements for:
   - design and development planning,
   - design input,
   - design output,
   - design review,
   - design verification,
   - design validation,
   - design transfer,
   - design changes, and
   - design history file  
   are fulfilled.

3. You have not adequately addressed the requirements for **21 CFR 820.50, Purchasing Controls**.  
   Please provide a summary of the procedure(s) at UCB for purchasing controls. The summary should delineate the purchasing control responsibilities at Proximagen and UCB:

   a. Describe supplier evaluation process and describe how it will determine type and extent of control you will exercise over suppliers.  
   b. Define how the records of acceptable suppliers will be maintained and how your firm addresses the purchasing data approval process.  
   c. Explain how your firm will balance purchasing assessment and receiving acceptance to ensure that products and services are acceptable for their intended use.  

   Please explain how the procedure(s) will ensure that changes made by contractors/suppliers will not affect the final combination product.  
   Please provide a description of how your firm applies the purchasing controls to the suppliers/contractors used in the manufacturing of the combination product. (e.g., through supplier agreement)

4. You have not adequately addressed the requirement for **21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and Preventive Actions**.  
   Specifically, it appears that UCB is integrated into the overall Quality System at your firm.  
   Please summarize the procedure(s) for your firm’s Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) System, and specifically delineate how each facility is responsible for your CAPA system.  
   The CAPA system should require:

   a. Identification of sources of quality data and analysis of these data to identify existing and potential causes of nonconforming practices and products;  
   b. Investigation of nonconformities and their causes;  
   c. Identification and implementation of actions needed to correct and prevent recurrence of nonconformities; and  
   d. Verification or validation of the actions taken.

5. Please provide a production flow diagram that identifies the steps involved in the manufacture of the finished combination product under review.  
   This diagram should specifically identify which facility is responsible for each step in your manufacturing process.  
   This information should display the important aspects of the production process.

6. Please explain how UCB will integrate into the processes for controlling the manufacturing of the combination product through:
   - receiving or incoming,
   - in-process, and
   - final acceptance activities.  

   You will need to specify which firm will perform the acceptance activities for:
   - the receiving of components/materials to be used in the combination product;
   - in-process testing performed during the manufacturing/assembly; and
   - the final release of the combination product.

   You will also need to provide the acceptance/rejection criteria for:
   - the receiving components/materials,
   - the in-process tests, and
   - the release of the finished combination product.
