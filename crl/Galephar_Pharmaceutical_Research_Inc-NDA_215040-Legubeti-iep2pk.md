## NDA 215040 – COMPLETE RESPONSE

**To:**  
Galephar Pharmaceutical Research Inc.  
Attention: Britta Martinez  
Director Regulatory Affairs  
Carr 925 Km 6.1 Bo Junquito  
HC-04 Box 4540  
Humacao, PR 00791

Dear Ms. Martinez:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received July 7, 2022, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Legubeti (acetylcysteine) for oral solution.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

1. **Tolerability of Legubeti**
   - You have not provided data to demonstrate the tolerability of Legubeti, the lysine salt of acetylcysteine, for the full range of loading and maintenance doses for patients with all body weights proposed in labeling.
   - Both lysine and acetylcysteine have an unpleasant taste, and acetylcysteine has an unpleasant odor that may affect the tolerability of oral ingestion. The data to address the effect of lysine on the palatability of Legubeti is inadequate.
   - The completed relative bioavailability study with 1g of acetylcysteine is not adequate to address palatability, as most patients will receive up to 15g based on the proposed weight-based dosage.
   - Timely administration of acetylcysteine is essential in mitigating toxicity from acetaminophen overdose. Uncertainty remains as to whether patients can ingest the full dose due to palatability/tolerability, which places them at increased risk of toxicity.

   **To resolve this deficiency:**  
   Conduct palatability and tolerability studies at clinically relevant doses. The proposed clinical investigation should include a patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instrument that is fit-for-purpose. We recommend reaching agreement with the Division of Clinical Outcomes Assessment (DCOA) regarding your PRO instrument before starting the studies.

2. **Safety of L-lysine in Pediatrics**
   - You have not provided adequate information to support the safety of L-lysine administration to pediatric patients weighing down to 1 kg.
   - The expected maximum daily L-lysine dosage ranges from 502.6 mg/kg/day (including loading dose) to 313 mg/kg/day after maintenance.
   - This exceeds the estimated daily intake of L-lysine in enterally fed term neonates.

   **To resolve this deficiency:**  
   Provide additional information (e.g., published literature or a study) to justify the safety of the L-lysine exposure in pediatric patients down to 1 kg for the proposed indication.

---

## REGULATORY

3. **Reliance on Referenced Drug Labeling**
   - The relied-upon listed drug for this 505(b)(2) application is Mucomyst. You cited the Cetylev labeling to comply with PLR and PLLR.
   - Referring to Cetylev for format purposes is acceptable. However, if relying on Cetylev’s findings of safety or effectiveness regarding Lactation, Pregnancy, and Females and Males of Reproductive Potential, you must comply with legal/regulatory requirements (e.g., scientific bridge, patent certification).
   - Alternatively, you may rely on non-product-specific published literature.

   **To resolve this deficiency:**  
   - (1) Cite and provide original publications that corroborate the proposed labeling language and are not based on FDA’s finding of a listed drug, or  
   - (2) Cite reliance on Cetylev and meet all associated legal/regulatory requirements.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

We encourage you to review the following websites for guidance:
- [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

Use the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) checklist to conform with format regulations and guidelines. Include updated content of labeling in SPL format as described at [Structured Product Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Refer to correspondence dated December 29, 2022. The proposed proprietary name, Legubeti, was found acceptable pending application approval. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When responding to the deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b):

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. Include:
   - New safety data using the same format as the original submission.
   - Tabulations of combined new and original safety data.
   - Tables comparing adverse event frequencies from original vs. updated data.
   - Separate adverse event frequency tables for non-indication trials.

3. Provide a retabulation of reasons for premature trial discontinuation, including newly completed trials. Describe any new trends.
4. Include case report forms and narrative summaries:
   - For deaths during clinical trials.
   - For those who discontinued due to adverse events.
   - For serious adverse events.

5. Describe any indications of substantial change in frequency of common but less serious adverse events.
6. Provide updated exposure information (e.g., number of subjects, person-time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience with safety, including updated use estimates in other countries.
8. Provide English translations of approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

- Consistent with USP nomenclature, we recommend describing the dosage form as "for oral solution" instead of "powder for oral solution."
- We recommend submitting a comprehensive summary of clinical pharmacology information for N-acetylcysteine and L-lysine from published literature along with the original articles.

---

## OTHER

Within one year of the date of this letter, you must:
- Resubmit the application, or
- Take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110.

Failure to act may be considered a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. Extensions may be requested.
