## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update. The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:

    - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
    - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
    - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
    - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each subject who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time). Include exposure expressed as subjects exposed to:
    
    - Kisunla 700 mg every 4 weeks for three doses followed by 1400 mg every 4 weeks for:
        - 6 months
        - 12 months
        - 76 weeks
        - 102 weeks
        - 130 weeks

    Also provide an accounting of the number of subjects who switched to placebo based on amyloid plaque reduction at Weeks 24, 52, 76, 102, and 130.

7. Provide a summary and analysis of all patients who had recurrent ARIA:

    - Include frequency of subjects with multiple episodes of ARIA (e.g., 1, 2, and 3 or more events)
    - Include information regarding patients who were treated through ongoing episodes of ARIA
    - Include a table with information about individual patients
    - Indicate whether the patient was asymptomatic or symptomatic (mild, moderate, or severe, if available) and the radiographic severity of ARIA

8. Provide a summary and analysis of cases of severe ARIA:

    - Include information regarding supportive care
    - Indicate whether patients had a full recovery
    - Include a table with information about individual patients

9. Provide a summary of your educational plan:

    - Educate prescribers regarding ARIA
    - Guide prescribers in identifying patients appropriate for Kisunla treatment
    - Identify and manage infusion-related reactions
    - Provide a summary of your educational program for patients and caregivers

10. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this product:

    - Include an updated estimate of use for product marketed in other countries

11. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.
