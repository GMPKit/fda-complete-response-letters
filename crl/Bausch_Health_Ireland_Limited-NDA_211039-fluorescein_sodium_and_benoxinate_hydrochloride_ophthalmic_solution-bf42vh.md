Dear Mr. Witham:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received September 24, 2018, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for fluorescein sodium and benoxinate hydrochloride ophthalmic solution.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. Specifically, the methods to be used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of the drug substance do not comply with the current good manufacturing practice regulations in parts 210 and 211.

During a recent inspection of manufacturing facility, our field investigator observed objectionable conditions at the facility and conveyed that information to the representative of the facility at the close of the inspection. Satisfactory resolution of the observations is required before this NDA may be approved and all facilities used for the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of the drug substance and drug product will need to be in compliance with the current good manufacturing practice regulations in parts 210 and 211.

When you respond to the above deficiency, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.
