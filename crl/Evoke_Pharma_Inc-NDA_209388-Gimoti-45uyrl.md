Dear Dr. Carlson,

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated May 30, 2018, received June 1, 2018, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), for Gimoti (metoclopramide nasal spray).

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Your pharmacokinetic (PK) bridge between the Gimoti 15 mg dose and the Reglan tablet 10 mg is insufficient to justify the reliance on the findings of safety and efficacy for Reglan to assure comparable safety and efficacy between Gimoti and Reglan.

We have concerns that your product is not able to deliver metoclopramide in a reliable and consistent manner. Several subjects demonstrated low Cmax (<5 ng/ml) for metoclopramide with one or more Gimoti administrations. This was not observed with Reglan tablet administration. The overall lower mean Cmax was driven by these individuals who appeared to receive very little drug. The reason for this observation is unclear.

### Recommendations to Address Deficiencies:

To address the clinical pharmacology deficiency, we recommend that you:

- Investigate the root cause(s) for the variability in PK for Gimoti, including the issue of inconsistent and incomplete delivery.
- Provide evidence supporting your conclusions from the root cause analysis.
- Provide mitigation strategies that will address the issue(s).
- Depending on the identified cause(s), conduct additional in vitro and/or in vivo studies.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY/DEVICE QUALITY

Your proposed specification for the drug product is inadequate since insufficient evidence has been provided to ensure that the quality control and essential performance characteristics of the combination product do not contribute to the observed clinical variability and lack of efficacy.

Specifically, the method and acceptance criterion for droplet size distribution is not deemed robust enough to guarantee consistent delivery of the drug to the patient with each actuation. The proposed acceptance criterion for droplet size distribution of the 15 mg/mL strength (i.e., the mean droplet sizes and calculated ranges) are not justified particularly given the observed variability of PK data.

### Recommendations to Address Deficiencies:

Upon resubmission, all proposed tests and acceptance criteria including the droplet sizes and other essential performance characteristics for the commercial product specification should be supported by:

- Three batches of drug product using the selected commercial formulation (including strength of the product) and the commercial device.
  - Manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site
  - Manufactured by the proposed commercial process
  - Tested using validated analytical methods at the proposed analytical site

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

These comments are not approvability issues but should be addressed in the complete response submission.

### PRODUCT QUALITY/DEVICE QUALITY

A. We recommend that actuation force be considered an essential performance requirement and that you:

- Include a test and acceptance criterion for actuation force in the product release and stability specification
- Include verification and validation data to support that specification
- Describe why this force is appropriate for the intended user population

Alternatively, provide a rationale for why you do not consider actuation force an essential performance requirement for the device constituent and how you will control the product.

B. You provided a specification for the lowest allowable cap removal force without defining the highest allowable force. We recommend:

- Including the upper cap removal force specification to ensure the cap will not be too difficult for the user to remove.

C. The proposed shelf-life of months is not supported by the submitted data. Upon resubmission:

- The proposed shelf life should be supported by three batches of the drug product using the selected commercial formulation (including strength of the product) and the proposed commercial device.

D. It is premature to agree to a reduced reporting category for an additional release and stability facility as proposed in your comparability protocol.

### CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

E. We recommend that you develop a lower dosage strength to address dosage adjustment for patients who may need a lower dose.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI).

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the prescribing information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Please refer to correspondence dated August 7, 2018, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Gimoti. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle.

Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described in 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. When assembling the sections describing:
   - Discontinuations due to adverse events
   - Serious adverse events
   - Common adverse events

   incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with retabulated frequencies.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for adverse event frequencies.

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

4. Provide:
   - Case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial
   - Summaries for patients who did not complete trials due to adverse events
   - Narrative summaries for serious adverse events

5. Describe any information suggesting a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

6. Provide updated exposure information (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

7. Provide summary of worldwide safety experience, including updated estimate of use in other countries.

8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

---

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. Failure to do so may be considered a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65.

You may request an extension of time to resubmit.

A resubmission must:

- Fully address all deficiencies listed
- Be clearly marked with "RESUBMISSION" in large, bold type on the cover letter
- Clearly state it is a complete response to the deficiencies

Note: A partial response will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference by submitting a meeting request as described in the draft FDA Guidance for Industry, “Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products,” December 2017 at:

https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM590547

The drug product may not be legally marketed until you are notified in writing that the application is approved.

If you have any questions, call Maureen Dewey, Senior Regulatory Project Manager, at (301) 796-0845.
