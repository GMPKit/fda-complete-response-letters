## Additional Comments

The effects of severe renal impairment on amisulpride pharmacokinetics are inadequately characterized. The drug was only studied in a limited number of such patients.

**Recommendation:**  
Conduct a pharmacokinetic study in patients with severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), using healthy individuals as a control group.
