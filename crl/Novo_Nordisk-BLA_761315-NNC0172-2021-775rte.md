## BLA 761315  
**COMPLETE RESPONSE**  
Novo Nordisk  
Attention: Ge (Larry) Bai  
Director, Regulatory Affairs  
P.O. Box 846  
800 Scudders Mill Road  
Plainsboro, NJ 08536  

Dear Mr. Bai,

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated and received August 24, 2022, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for NNC0172-2021 injection.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated April 19, 2023, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

1. Despite fixed maintenance doses of NNC0172-2021, significant fluctuations in concentrations were noted in patients over the treatment period. At the target exposure range of 200 - 4000 ng/mL, target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) plays a dominant role.

2. The plan to require only a single occurrence of pharmacokinetics (PK) monitoring after four weeks of dosing may not be sufficient. More frequent PK monitoring may be necessary or further clarification should be provided.

---

## DEVICE

3. Validation of the NNC0172-2021 ELISA is inadequate:
   - Include correlation/cross-validation study with sufficient native patient samples covering a relevant concentration range (e.g., <200 ng/mL, 200–4000 ng/mL, >4000 ng/mL).

4. Precision study should include:
   - Instrument-to-instrument precision
   - Lot-to-lot precision

5. Conduct a dose-response study for substances that may interfere with the assay (e.g., hemoglobin, cholesterol, triglyceride, Factor VII, biotin, ledipasvir, acetaminophen).

6. Provide sample stability data using the NNC0172-2021 ELISA.

7. Provide root-cause analysis for underestimation of NNC0172-2021 concentrations in contrived samples.

> The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) strongly recommends that each of the above issues be discussed in a post-action meeting.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

8. Risk assessments and control strategies were found insufficient to ensure product quality, safety, and efficacy.

9. DS release and stability specifications acceptance criteria are inadequate:
   - Provide assurance of batch-to-batch consistency
   - Provide justifications for specified limits

10. DP release and stability specifications are inadequate. Address deficiencies to ensure batch consistency.

11. MCB and WCB stability protocols are inadequate:
   - Update to include defined tests and acceptance criteria

12. PRM and SRM stability protocols are inadequate.

13. DS post-approval stability protocol (3.2.S.7.2) is inadequate.

14. DP post-approval stability protocol (3.2.P.8.2) is inadequate.

15. Identity testing and tracking description (3.2.P.3.3) is insufficient—revise to specify physical characteristics as required under 21 CFR 610.14.

---

### Device Constituent

16. Post-approval DP stability protocol must include EPRs (dose accuracy, activation force, hold force, injection time).

17. DP release specifications must include the same EPRs.

---

## FACILITY INSPECTION

18. Manufacturing facility inspection revealed deficiencies. Satisfactory resolution required prior to approval.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Comment is reserved until the application is otherwise adequate. Refer to:

- [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

Comment is reserved until application is otherwise adequate.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Refer to correspondence dated November 21, 2022. Name "Alhemo" was found acceptable pending application approval. Resubmit proposed proprietary name with response.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

Include the following with your resubmission:

1. Changes in safety profile
2. New safety data (submission format, tabulations, and comparisons)
3. Updated premature discontinuation tabulation
4. Case report forms and narratives for deaths and SAEs
5. Change in common AE incidence
6. Exposure information
7. Global safety summary
8. English translations of foreign labeling

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS (NOT APPROVABILITY ISSUES)
