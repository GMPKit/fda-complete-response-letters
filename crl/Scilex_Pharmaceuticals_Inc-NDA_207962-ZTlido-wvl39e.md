Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated July 10, 2015, received July 10, 2015, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for ZTlido (lidocaine patch 1.8%).

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated March 18 and 24, and April 11, 14 and 15, 2016, which was not reviewed for this action.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below.

---

## REGULATORY

1. Under 21 CFR 314.54(a)(1)(vi), a 505(b)(2) application must contain a patent certification or statement. Your application does not contain a patent certification or statement for the relevant referenced drug products and patent listings in the Orange Book.

   - To address this deficiency:  
     - Either remove references to the listed products  
     - Or submit appropriate patent certifications/statements

2. Your application relies on studies described in published literature.  
   - Provide scientific justification for each referenced study  
   - Include copies of the referenced publications and identify listed drug(s) described (e.g. trade names)

---

## CLINICAL

3. The 74-day letter dated September 22, 2015, included the following concern regarding adhesion:

   > “You have submitted only a one-time adhesion evaluation after 48 hours for subjects in Cohort 1 of your dermal sensitization…”

   - To address this deficiency:  
     - Submit 12-hour adhesion data from Study SCI-LIDO-DERM-001, or  
     - Conduct a new study with appropriate labeling/usage conditions of both ZTlido and Lidoderm

4. Additional data from Study SCI-LIDO-ADH-001 were not reviewed, but may be referenced in your response.

---

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

5. Study SCI-LIDO-PK-001 cannot establish bioequivalence due to use of surgical tape on Lidoderm patches.

   - To address this deficiency:  
     - Conduct a new comparative bioavailability study using unmodified Lidoderm per its label  
   - Data from Study SCI-LIDO-HEX-001 were not reviewed but can be referenced

---

## NONCLINICAL

6. Proposed specification for 2,6-xylidine exceeds the ICH M7 acceptable daily intake level (10 mcg/day).

   - To address:  
     - Reduce 2,6-xylidine to NMT 10 mcg/day  
     - Or provide data to demonstrate actual exposure is below that of the listed drug

7. Impurities exceed ICH Q3B(R2) qualification thresholds.

   - Options to address:  
     - Reduce to NMT 0.2% or 3 mg/day  
     - Or conduct:  
       - Two in vitro genetic toxicology assays  
       - A 90-day repeat-dose toxicology study

8. Inadequate information to justify systemic safety of dipropylene glycol, isostearic acid, SIS block copolymer, and terpene resin.

   - Provide risk assessment including:  
     - Leachables study  
     - Absorption data  
     - Molecular weight analysis  
     - Evaluation of chronic, genetic, reproductive, and carcinogenic toxicity  
     - At least 3 months of safety justification

9. Insufficient information provided for polyisobutylene excipient.

   - Submit:  
     - Molecular weight ranges  
     - Toxicological risk assessment

10. Inadequate leachables evaluation.

    - Submit:  
      - Toxicological risk assessment  
      - Extractables and leachables data over time for three batches  
      - Genetic toxicity assessment for genotoxic leachables
