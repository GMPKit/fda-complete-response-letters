### NDA 211363

Your 505(b)(2) application relies upon the Agency’s finding of safety and effectiveness for NDA 205029 for Epinephrine, but does not contain a patent certification or statement with respect to each patent listed in FDA’s “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (the Orange Book) for the listed drug upon which you rely.

Specifically, your application does not contain a patent certification or statement with respect to patents `10,004,700` and `10,039,728` listed in the Orange Book. Please submit an appropriate patent certification or statement with respect to these patents.

If you elect to provide a paragraph IV certification (21 CFR 314.50(i)(1)(i)(A)(4)) with respect to these patents, the certification must be accompanied by a statement of compliance with:

- 314.52(a): Notice to each owner of the patent or their representatives and to the holder of the approved application for the drug product claimed by the patent or a use of which is claimed by the patent.
- 314.52(c): Content of the notice.

### Prescribing Information

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the:

- PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information website
- Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule website

These include regulations, related guidance documents, and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) — a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

If labeling is revised:

- Use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the prescribing information conforms with regulatory format requirements.
- Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in Structured Product Labeling (SPL) format, as described at:

  http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm

---

### Safety Update

When responding to the deficiencies above, include a safety update as described in 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug/product, regardless of:

- Indication
- Dosage form
- Dose level

Include the following:

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. For discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data:
    - Present new safety data from studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the original submission format.
    - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with original application data.
    - Include tables comparing frequencies of adverse events from the original and updated data.
    - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables of adverse event frequencies.
3. Retabulate reasons for premature trial discontinuation including dropouts from newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.
4. Provide:
    - Case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial due to an adverse event.
    - Narrative summaries for serious adverse events.
5. Describe any information suggesting substantial changes in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between new and original data.
6. Provide updated exposure information for clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the drug's safety, including updated estimates of use in other countries.
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.
