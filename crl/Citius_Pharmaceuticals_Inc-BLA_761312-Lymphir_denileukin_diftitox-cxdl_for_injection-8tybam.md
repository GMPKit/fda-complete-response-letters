We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. Below are the reasons for this action, with recommendations to address these issues where possible.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Before resubmitting the labeling:

- Submit updated content of labeling [21 CFR 601.14(b)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at [FDA SPL Guide](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

To facilitate our review:

- Provide a highlighted or marked-up copy showing all changes.
- Include a clean Word version.
- The marked-up copy should include annotations supporting any proposed changes.

Your proposed Prescribing Information (PI) must conform to the content and format regulations found at 21 CFR 201.56(a), 201.56(d), and 201.57.

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Please refer to correspondence dated March 24, 2023, addressing the proposed proprietary name, **Lymphir**. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to this letter.

---

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

An inspection of the (FEI #) facility is required before this application can be approved.

FDA must assess the ability of that facility to conduct listed manufacturing operations in compliance with CGMP. Due to the timing of incorporation of the site into the license application, we were unable to conduct an inspection during the current review cycle.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When responding to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). This should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

2. When providing data on discontinuations, serious adverse events, and common adverse events:
   - Present new safety data using the same format as the original submission.
   - Provide tabulations combining new and original application data.
   - Include tables comparing frequencies of events in original vs. updated data.
   - For other indications, provide separate tables of adverse event frequencies.
3. Retabulate reasons for premature trial discontinuation; describe any new trends or patterns.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for:
   - Each subject who died during a trial.
   - Subjects who did not complete due to an adverse event.
