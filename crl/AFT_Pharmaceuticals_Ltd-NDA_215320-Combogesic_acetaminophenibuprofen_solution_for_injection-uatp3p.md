## NDA 215320 – COMPLETE RESPONSE  

**AFT Pharmaceuticals Ltd.**  
c/o Chesapeake Regulatory Group, Inc.  
6574 River Clyde Drive  
Highland, MD 20777  

**Attention:** David Zuchero, MS, JD  
US Agent for AFT Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.  

Dear Mr. Zuchero,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received August 31, 2021, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Combogesic (acetaminophen/ibuprofen) solution for injection.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated June 20, 2022, and received June 21, 2022, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## NONCLINICAL

You have not provided adequate toxicological risk assessments for leachables over the 5 mcg/day qualification threshold. We acknowledge your original approach in utilizing a toxicological threshold of concern of 120 mcg/day as recommended in ICH M7. However, this approach only addresses the genotoxicity aspects of a compound and is not acceptable to address the general toxicity of any given leachable compound.

We also acknowledge receipt of the June 21, 2022 submission containing a toxicological risk assessment for tentatively identified compounds detected above the analytical evaluation threshold. However, this submission was not formally reviewed because, as noted in your cover letter, the compounds have only been tentatively identified to date and method validation is still ongoing. Our assessment of the safety of leachables to support a marketing application should be based on confirmed compounds quantified using validated methods.

### Information Needed to Address the Deficiency

Submit a revised toxicological risk assessment for all leachable compounds detected above the 5 mcg/day threshold. Submit documentation that the structural identification of the compounds has been confirmed and quantification has been completed using validated methods. The risk assessment should be based on the maximum level of each leachable expected to be present in the drug product based upon the analysis of the data from your long-term stability samples. The approach should be based on good scientific principles. Include copies of all referenced studies.

**In addition, consider the following points:**

a. If you employ a Permissible Daily Exposure (PDE) assessment as described in ICH Q3C, provide justification for all safety factors employed.  
b. Published literature rarely provides adequate detail of the study design and study results to permit a thorough evaluation. Summaries such as BIBRA, CIR, and HERA are not acceptable unless original source material is provided. Submission of any published study reports should be accompanied by a detailed comparison to modern toxicology endpoints, and their shortcomings should be addressed.  
c. Safety justifications based on analogous compounds are not acceptable unless supported by adequate data, including a detailed understanding of ADME and scientific bridging to a NOAEL.
