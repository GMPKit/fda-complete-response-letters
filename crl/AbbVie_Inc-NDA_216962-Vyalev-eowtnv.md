## CENTER FOR DEVICES AND RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH

### Vyafuser Device Instructions for Use

- Patient and provider labeling lacks recommended content per FDA’s *Infusion Pumps Total Product Life Cycle* guidance.
- Missing information may affect flow accuracy (e.g., head height, backpressure).
- No supporting performance testing for those parameters found in the submission.

**Labeling must account for safe use of the device.**

[Infusion Pumps Guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/78369/download)

---

### Design Verification Findings

- Device not fully tested under environmental/use conditions as required per 21 CFR §820.30(f).
- Testing lacks evaluation for performance under:
  - Head height/backpressure conditions  
  - Full delivery duration  
- Specific standard referenced (IEC 60601-2-24:2012) is not fully FDA recognized.

#### Recommendations:

- Evaluate accuracy over initial 24 hours  
- Demonstrate accuracy at:  
  - Representative flow rates  
  - Variable temperatures, viscosities, and pressures  
  - Minimum, intermediate, and maximum flow rates  
- Combine conditions in testing (e.g., backpressure + temperature)  
- Include cyclic/vibrational shock testing for wearable conditions  
- Define time intervals for accuracy specification (e.g., mL/24 hours)  

---

## MEDICATION GUIDE

- Add to labeling:  
  `"ATTENTION PHARMACIST: Each patient is required to receive the enclosed Medication Guide."`  
  per 21 CFR 208.24(d)

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON HUMAN FACTORS

- If user interface (UI) is revised, update use-related risk analysis (URRA).
- For any changes, submit:
  - URRA
  - Comparative analyses (labeling, tasks, physical comparison)
- If HF validation study is not required, submit justification and documentation.
- If study is required, submit protocol for FDA feedback before study.
- Consider adding an alarm troubleshooting guide physically attached to device.
- Include helpline contact info on pump.

---

## OTHER
