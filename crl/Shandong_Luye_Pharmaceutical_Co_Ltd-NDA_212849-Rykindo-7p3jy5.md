# NDA 212849 – Complete Response Letters

## Shandong Luye Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.  
502 Carnegie Center, Suite 100  
Princeton, NJ 08540

## Complete Response Letter (February 18, 2022)

### Clinical and Clinical Pharmacology

- January 28, 2020 CR letter requested a root-cause analysis for unexplained concentration spikes in Study LY03004/CT-USA-102.
- Re-analysis found cocaine in two patient samples; applicant attributed spikes to CYP2D6 inhibition.
- FDA disagrees:
  - Risperidone increases <80% with CYP2D6 inhibition—not sufficient to explain 300–500% spikes.
  - Cocaine not verified as strong CYP2D6 inhibitor.
  - Intrapatient variability not justified by genetic CYP2D6 differences.
- Safety and dose dumping concerns remain unresolved.

#### Required Data for Resubmission

- Full PK study reports from all ex-U.S. trials (China, EU):
  - Mean and individual subject data.
  - Plots, tables, and figures.
- Additional data:
  - Real-world usage (if available).
  - Adverse events, especially of special interest.
  - Subjects with concentration spikes or suspected dose dumping:
    - Vital signs and ECG summaries.

### Product Quality

#### Biopharmaceutics Deficiency

- Biowaiver request (12.5, 37.5, 50 mg) not granted.
- Pivotal BE study concerns persist.
- Clinical/pharmacological issues must be fully addressed before waiver reconsideration.

---

### Prescribing Information

- Labeling review deferred until application is adequate.
- Use the SRPI checklist.
- Updated content required per 21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i).
- References:

  - [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

### Carton and Container Labeling

- Comments deferred until deficiencies addressed.

### Proprietary Name

- Rykindo acceptable pending resolution.
- Resubmit name in next correspondence.

---

### Safety Update

Submit per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b), including:

1. Safety profile changes/findings.
2. New safety data:
   - Combined/tabulated with original data.
   - Separate tables for other indications.
3. Premature discontinuation data (retabulated).
4. Narratives and CRFs for:
   - Deaths
   - Serious adverse events
5. Trends in common, non-serious adverse events.
6. Clinical exposure summary.
7. Global post-marketing safety and usage data.
8. English translations of current foreign labeling.

---

### Other

- Resubmission/action required within 1 year (21 CFR 314.110).
- Must fully resolve all deficiencies and be labeled "RESUBMISSION".
- Partial responses will not initiate review.
- Formal meetings may be requested per [PDUFA guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/109951/download).
- Product unmarketable until approval granted.

## Complete Response Letter (January 28, 2020)

### Clinical and Clinical Pharmacology

- PK bridging to Risperdal CONSTA accepted.
- Three patients (~6%) in Study LY03004/CT-USA-102 exhibited unexplained concentration spikes.

#### Concerns

1. Spikes up to 100 ng/mL at 25 mg dose—a 5x increase; 50 mg dose could yield ~200 ng/mL.
2. Raises risk of unsafe exposure post-approval.

#### Required Actions

- Investigate root cause of spikes.
- Outline mitigation for post-market exposure issues.

---

### Product Quality

#### General Deficiencies

- Detail scale-up changes and compare clinical vs. commercial product.
- Justify observed differences in drug release at 72 vs. 80 hours.
- Recommend IVIVC/IVIVR model to support application.

#### Biowaiver Request (12.5, 37.5, 50 mg)

Rejected due to:

1. Unresolved clinical PK concerns.
2. No in vitro release testing with final product.

##### Required:

- Drug release comparison (n=12) for all strengths under proposed labeling.
- Statistical similarity analysis (e.g., f2 factor) vs. BE strength.

---

### Use-Related Risk Analysis (URRA)

- URRA (May 6, 2019) and addendum (September 26, 2019) incomplete:
  - Failed to identify risk of improper resuspension.
  - Critical administration tasks not evaluated for usability.

#### Required Actions

- Submit:
  - Updated user instructions.
  - Revised URRA.
  - Human factors validation study results/protocol for FDA feedback.
- Refer to guidance:
  - [Human Factors for Medical Devices](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/applying-human-factors-and-usability-engineering-medical-devices)
  - [Design to Minimize Medication Errors](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/safety-considerations-product-design-minimize-medication-errors)
  - [Complete Submissions for Human Factors](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/contents-complete-submission-threshold-analyses-and-human-factors-submissions-drug-and-biologic)

- File in eCTD Section 5.3.5.4.

---

### Facility Inspections

- Inspection deficiencies must be resolved prior to marketing approval.

---

### Additional Comments (Not Approvability Issues)

1. Use of IVIVC/IVIVR model encouraged due to:
   - No reconstitution in in vitro testing.
   - No strength-specific release evaluation.
   - Scale-up and PK spike concerns.
2. advise testing impact of temperature on reconstituted product pharmacokinetics.

---

### Prescribing Information

- Labeling deferred.
