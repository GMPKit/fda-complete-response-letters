## NDA 202860  
**COMPLETE RESPONSE**

**Applicant:**  
Vero Biotech, LLC  
Attention: Alfred W. Schweikert, PhD, RAC  
Vice President of Regulatory Affairs  
387 Technology Circle NW, Suite 125  
Atlanta, GA 30313

Dear Dr. Schweikert:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received July 23, 2018, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for GeNOsylÂ® Delivery System (Nitric Oxide).

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated December 18, 2018, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

During a recent inspection of the Vero Biotech manufacturing facility (FEI: 3014617112) for this NDA, our field investigators conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this NDA may be considered for approval.

---

## CDRH (DEVICE)

1. In prior communication, we noted your device incorporates sensory feedback for adjustment of Nitric Oxide delivery and flow rate. Due to the closed-loop technology utilized in the design of the proposed device, FDA believes conformance to certain clauses of this standard will provide evidence of safety and adequate performance.  
   In order for FDA to be assured of the safety of your device, we previously requested the following:
   
   - Evidence of conformity to certain clauses/sub-clauses (specific clauses redacted)
   - Performance testing to demonstrate that under various disturbances or variabilities the device meets the following:
     - The transient specifications will continue to be met. Please quantify the relevant transients such as overshoot, undershoot.
     - The control system continues to be stable. You may provide this evidence either analytically or experimentally:
       - **Analytic stability**: Mathematical model with pole/zero analysis, relative and absolute stability
       - **Experimental stability**: Demonstrate stability for an extended, clinically relevant duration

2. The device appears to be tested by software only to demonstrate delivery shutdown at NOâ‚‚ levels exceeding 3 ppm. Please provide physical device testing.

3. Provide information on electrostatic discharge (ESD) immunity.

4. Due to the use of passive RFID tags in hospital environments, test immunity to RFID readers according to FDA-recognized AIM standard 7351731 or equivalent. Include information in the Operator's Manual.

5. Your device relies on an internal battery. Provide:

   - Surface temperature in the event of a battery short circuit  
   - Demonstration that battery manufacturer safety requirements are met after integration

---

## HUMAN FACTORS

1. The HF validation study did not adequately evaluate participants' ability to detect and react to critical alarms. Simulated use scenarios failed to represent actual alarm conditions.

2. Confounding variables occurred during the simulation study that make it difficult to interpret critical task performance.

3. Numerous use errors occurred in the study, potentially leading to delays, interruptions, or overdose of therapy.

4. Revisions to user documentation and interface were not subsequently validated via a new HF study. Per guidance, these changes require user testing.

**Recommendations:**

- Evaluate observed use-related errors  
- Implement mitigation strategies  
- Update risk analysis  
- Conduct a new HF validation study  
- Submit protocol for FDA review before commencement

## REGULATORY

You must amend your application to include documentation of timely sending and receipt of notice of Paragraph IV certification (21 CFR 314.52(e)).

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Comment is deferred until the application is otherwise adequate.

Please review:

- PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information  
- Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule  
- [Structured Product Labeling (SPL) Guidance](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Review is suspended pending application deficiency response. Resubmit proposed proprietary name with your response.

---

## DETERMINATION OF PRODUCT EXPIRATION DATE

Hold-time for antioxidant cartridges has not been established. Proposed 12-month expiration for GeNOsylÂ® drug product cassette is acceptable, but date must be based on oldest cartridge used.

---

## OTHER

Within one year of this letter, resubmit or take action under 21 CFR 314.110. Otherwise, the application may be considered withdrawn.

**Resubmission guidance:**

- Clearly label submission as "RESUBMISSION"  
- Cover letter should indicate complete response  
- Partial responses will not be accepted as resubmissions  

You may request a meeting or teleconference per FDA Guidance:  
[Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products (Dec 2017)](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM590547)
