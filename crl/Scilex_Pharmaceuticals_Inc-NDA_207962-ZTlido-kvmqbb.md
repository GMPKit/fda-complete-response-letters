### REGULATORY

1. Under 21 CFR 314.54(a)(1)(vi), a 505(b)(2) application must contain a patent certification or statement for any relevant patents that claim the listed drug(s). Your application:

   - Includes a reference to a listed drug in annotated labeling
   - Does **not** contain a patent certification or statement for patents listed in the Orange Book

   **To address this deficiency:**

   - Remove references to the listed drug  
     **OR**  
   - Submit appropriate patent certification/statements for each listed patent.  
   - If submitting a Paragraph IV certification, comply with 21 CFR 314.52(a) and (c).  
   - If relying on an FDA finding of safety and/or effectiveness, provide a scientific “bridge” (e.g., bioavailability data) between your product and the listed drug.

2. Your application relies on studies described in published literature.

   **To address this deficiency:**

   - Provide scientific justification for each essential literature reference.
   - Submit copies of referenced literature in the application.
   - Identify listed drug trade names if applicable.

---

### CLINICAL

3. The 74-day letter (Sept 22, 2015) noted inadequate adhesion evaluation.

> “You have submitted only a one-time adhesion evaluation after 48 hours...”

Since the product is intended for 12-hour use, 48-hour data is not supportive.

**To address this deficiency:**

- Submit 12-hour adhesion data from Study SCI-LIDO-DERM-001  
  **OR**  
- Conduct a new study using the intended product-use duration and methodology.

Study SCI-LIDO-ADH-001 data may be referenced in the response.

---

### CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

4. Comparative bioavailability Study SCI-LIDO-PK-001 used surgical tape to secure Lidoderm patches, violating bioequivalence conditions.

**To address this deficiency:**

- Conduct a new comparative study per Lidoderm labeling (no overlay/tape). Study SCI-LIDO-HEX-001 may be referenced.

---

### NONCLINICAL

5. Proposed 2,6-xylidine (a known rat carcinogen) exceeds acceptable daily intake.

**To address this deficiency:**

- Reduce to ≤10 mcg/day  
  **OR**  
- Show release/exposure aligns with the listed drug.

6. Proposed impurity levels exceed ICH Q3B(R2) thresholds.

**To address this deficiency:**

- Reduce specs to NMT 0.2% or 3 mg TDI  
  **OR**  
- Qualify via:
  - Two in-vitro genetic toxicology studies
  - 90-day repeat-dose toxicology study  
  - Alternatively, justify comparative safety analytically.

[ICH Q3B(R2)](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm073389.pdf)  
[ICH Q3C](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073394.pdf)  
[FDA ANDAs Impurities](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM072861.pdf)

7. Systemic safety of excipients (dipropylene glycol, isostearic acid, SIS copolymer, terpene resin) is inadequately justified.

**To address this deficiency:**

- Submit toxicological risk assessments based on maximum daily dose:
  - Leachables data, if available
  - Absorption/molecular data if applicable

8. Polyisobutylene molecular weight data is incomplete.

**To address this deficiency:**

- Submit MW range (low/high), absorption profile, and toxicological analysis.

9. Leachables assessment is insufficient.

**To address this deficiency:**

- Analyze extractables/leachables from 3+ batches across stability periods.
- Evaluate residual monomers.
- Provide tox assessments for:
  - Leachables >5 mcg/day
  - Genotoxic alerts >10 mcg/day

### PRODUCT QUALITY

#### Drug Product

10. Drug Master File (DMF) referenced has deficiencies.  
    - A deficiency letter has been issued to the DMF holder.

11. Another referenced DMF is also deficient.  
    - Provide the product name tied to this DMF.  
    - A deficiency letter was issued.

12. Residual drug testing is required for the bioavailability study.

**To address this deficiency:**

- Submit residue data from actual patch use (skin, packaging).
- Provide control data from unused patches.

13–14. Data withheld as confidential (CCI/TS).

---

### BIOPHARMACEUTICS

39. No in vitro drug release stability data for 12 registration lot units was submitted.

**To address this deficiency:**

- Submit mean, SD, profile, and individual results from 12 units of registration lots.

---

### PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Labeling review pending until application is otherwise adequate.

- Ensure compliance with PLR and SRPI checklist.
- Submit updated SPL (Structured Product Labeling) file.

---

### PROPRIETARY NAME

ZTlido (lidocaine patch 1.8%) name is tentatively acceptable pending final approval.

- Resubmit the name upon CRL response.

---

### FACILITY INSPECTIONS

Deficiencies were observed during inspections of a referenced manufacturer and Oishi Koseido Co. Ltd.

- Resolve identified issues prior to approval.

---

### SAFETY UPDATE

Submit an update under 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b) with the following:

1. Updated safety data
2. Tabulated new safety findings
3. Updated data on early terminations
4. Case reports for deaths/serious AEs
5. Trend summary of minor AEs
6. Updated exposure information
7. Global post-marketing safety summary
8. Foreign labels with English translations

---

### ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

#### Clinical

ZTlido caused more local skin reactions than Lidoderm in clinical trials:

- 8% of subjects: Grade ≥3 irritation (vs. 0%)
- 26% of subjects: Cumulative score ≥2 (vs. 1.8%)
- Three serious dermal adverse events noted

**To address this:**

- Fully describe the events (background, intervention, outcomes)
- Provide a dermal risk-benefit analysis

#### Product Quality

1. Missing test results for lidocaine content in adhesive  
7. Add Impurity A to specifications and revise methods  
8. March 24, 2016 leachables data not reviewed  
9. Shelf-life to be determined after deficiencies resolved  
10. Environmental Assessment reference was incorrect – update with correct CFR citation

---

### NONCLINICAL (Post-Marketing Requirements)

Per [Nonclinical Studies for Excipients](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM079250.pdf):

1. 6-month systemic tox study in rodents (for all excipients unless justified)  
2. 9-month dermal tox study in minipigs (final drug)  
3. Dermal carcinogenicity in rodents  
4. Systemic carcinogenicity in second species

---

### OTHER

Respond within 1 year under 21 CFR 314.110. Inaction may trigger withdrawal.

- Partial responses do **not** initiate a new review cycle.
- Consider a formal meeting per [FDA Guidance](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM153222.pdf).
