- Ophthalmic Ointments <771>  
- Drug Release <1724>  
- Validate IVRT including 2% and 4% altered formulations using appropriate buffer

### Labeling

We reserve comment on labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. Labeling must be in SPL format.

1. Significant safety changes  
2. Updated AE/SAE data  
3. Trial discontinuations  
4. Narrative summaries

6. Updated exposure  
7. Global summary  
8. Foreign labeling translations  

### Other
