### Contact:  
**Gisela Sharp**  
Senior Manager, Regulatory Affairs

## Application Summary

- Original NDA Date: July 20, 2013  
- Received Date: July 22, 2013  
- Application for: Primatene Mist (epinephrine inhalation aerosol), 125 mcg per spray  
- Submitted under: Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act  

---

## CLINICAL DEFICIENCIES

### Findings

- Consumer studies do not support proposed OTC use for asthma relief.
- The Human Factors (HF) study (G3) failed to show safe and effective use by intended users.

#### HF Study Issues

- ~30% of participants failed at least one critical use task:
  - Task 1: Initial priming of inhaler (13%)
  - Task 2: Cleaning of inhaler (12%)
  - Task 3: Routine/re-priming use (13%)

### Risk

- Incorrect task performance may lead to ineffective or unsafe dosage delivery.
- Errors were clinically significant and caused concern for perceived inefficacy.

---

### Information Needed to Address Deficiency

- Consider developing a different inhaler device or optimize labeling for better understanding/use.
- Suggested labeling changes include:
  1. Improve embossed mouthpiece instructions (font contrast)
  2. Align actuator language with DFL and CIL
  3. Add pictograms for key usage steps

- Reevaluate:
  - Primary task failures
  - Root causes
  - Risk analysis
  - Mitigation strategies

- Conduct a new HF validation study:
  - Include at least 15 participants per user group (e.g., low literacy, adolescents, asthma patients)
  - Avoid prompting or statements that influence behavior
  - Submit HF validation study protocol for FDA review

- Discuss and document:
  - Device disassembly rates
  - Capability to reassemble
  - Time required for reassembly

- Submit data to:
  - eCTD section 5.3.5.4 – Other Study reports

## ADDITIONAL DEFICIENCIES

### PRODUCT QUALITY

- cGMP deficiencies observed during facility inspection.
- Satisfactory resolution required before approval.

### NONCLINICAL

- Thymol not qualified for chronic inhalation use.  
  > Must provide safety data or conduct a 6-month repeated dose inhalation toxicity study.

---

### CLINICAL (2014 Response Summary)

- Phase 3 trials: frequent device malfunction reports (clogging, dose indicator issues).
- Labeling comprehension inadequate (priming, cleaning, reassembly, etc.).
- Behavioral study:
  - Did not assess consumer ability independently
  - Study design flawed due to prompting, sink absence, reassembly not tested
  - Low-literacy populations inadequately represented

---

### Information Needed

1. Revise labeling:
   - Emphasize priming, cleaning, indicator use, orientation
2. Conduct behavioral (HF) study:
   - Use actual product, include low-literacy users, do not prompt
3. Execute randomized actual use study:
   - Include marketed benchmark product, assess device issues, user error

---

### Additional Safety Summary Instructions (As Above)

### Additional Recommendations

1. Add acceptance criteria for dose indicator accuracy.
2. Revise DFL:
    ```
