During a recent inspection of the Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd (FEI 3005757050) manufacturing facility for this NDA, our field investigator observed objectionable conditions at the facilities and conveyed that information to the representatives of the facilities at the close of the inspections. Satisfactory resolution of the observations is required before this NDA may be approved.

2. Supporting drug master file has been reviewed and is currently inadequate. Deficiency comments have been forwarded to the holder of this file.

3. Provide the stability results for the 30-month (25°C/60% RH) time-point for your registration batches to assure that all acceptance criteria are met, all potential leachables are absent or below levels of safety concern.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

1. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) − a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

   - If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances.

   - Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at [FDA SPL Information](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

## PROPRIETARY NAME

2. Please refer to correspondence dated August 13, 2018 which addresses the proposed proprietary name, RYALTRIS. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:

   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.

   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.

   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.

   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drugs marketed in other countries.

8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.
