Dear Mr. Blanks:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated June 26, 2020, received June 29, 2020, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for tenapanor hydrochloride 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg tablets.

We acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated April 28, 2021, which extended the goal date by three months.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## CLINICAL

To support efficacy as monotherapy for reducing serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis, you submitted the results of two randomized, multi-center trials (TEN-02-201 and TEN-02-301). You also submitted the results of a third trial — a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (TEN-02-202), to support use in combination with existing phosphate binder treatment. All three studies evaluated tenapanor’s efficacy in reducing serum phosphorus levels.

In epidemiologic studies, elevated serum phosphorus levels have been associated with an increased risk of secondary hyperparathyroidism, vascular, valvular, and other soft tissue calcification and cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD. In patients on dialysis, higher serum phosphorus levels have also been associated with increased mortality.

To date, however, there are no data from outcome studies demonstrating that a treatment’s effect on serum phosphorus levels predicts its effect on clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events or mortality. Nevertheless, the Division of Cardiology and Nephrology, following the precedent set by the former Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products, treats serum phosphorus reduction as a valid surrogate in patients with CKD on dialysis. All currently marketed products for the control of serum phosphorus in patients with CKD on dialysis were approved based on effects on serum phosphorus levels. In the trials conducted to support approval, these therapies lowered serum phosphorus levels by ~1.5 – 2.2 mg/dL.

In both monotherapy trials, tenapanor’s efficacy in reducing serum phosphorus levels was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal period.

- In Study TEN-02-201, which compared different dosing strategies, an 8-week double-blind randomized treatment period preceded the randomized withdrawal phase.
- In Study TEN-02-301, which included an active comparator, a 26-week open-label, randomized treatment period preceded this phase.

In both studies, the primary efficacy analysis during the randomized withdrawal period was to be based on the Efficacy Analysis Set, a subset of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which was intended to enrich for a responder population. Specifically, the Efficacy Analysis Set limited the primary efficacy analysis to patients who achieved a reduction of ≥ 1.2 mg/dL in serum phosphorus level in the treatment period prior to randomized withdrawal.

- In Study TEN-02-301, approximately 60% of patients finished the 26-week treatment period and were re-randomized.
- In Study TEN-02-201, approximately 75% completed the 8-week treatment period and entered the 4-week randomized withdrawal.

Of those who entered the randomized withdrawal, approximately half were excluded from the Efficacy Analysis Set.

Among the trials, the largest treatment effect was observed in the Efficacy Analysis Set of Study TEN-02-301:

- The point estimate of the treatment difference in the LS mean change in serum phosphorus from baseline to end of the 12-week randomized withdrawal was 1.37 mg/dL.
- However, this is unclear in significance as it derives from a subset.

ITT population analyses:

- TEN-02-201: 0.72 mg/dL
- TEN-02-301: 0.66 mg/dL

Subgroup analyses and responses:

- Did not suggest a “responder” population with substantially larger effect.
- In Study TEN-02-301, larger effect size found in patients with higher baseline levels, but smaller than that of active control.
- Study TEN-02-202 (combination therapy): 0.65 mg/dL

While the data support that tenapanor reduces serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis, the treatment effect is small and of unclear clinical significance, particularly in absence of outcome data linking surrogate and clinical benefit.

### To obtain approval:

An additional adequate and well-controlled trial demonstrating a **clinically relevant** treatment effect on serum phosphorus or clinical outcome is required.

> A strategy of individualized treatment based on early response could be considered, but must be **prospectively tested** and incorporate multiple measurements to mitigate variability.
