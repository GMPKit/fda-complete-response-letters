# COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER  
**Application Number:** NDA 208352  
**Sponsor:** Evofem, Inc.  
**Drug Product:** Amphora (lactic acid 1.76%, citric acid 1%, potassium bitartrate 0.4%) vaginal gel  
**Date Received:** July 2, 2015  

## Clinical

Based on marked disparities in pregnancy, discontinuation, loss to follow-up, and adverse event reporting rates between the US and Russian cohorts in the study, the Russian data are not considered generalizable to the US population. Therefore, the approvability decision is based solely on the US data.

Due to the high proportion of non-evaluable cycles and the high premature discontinuation rate, the study did not provide sufficient cycles (<5,000 requested) for safety and efficacy analysis.

Concerns expressed throughout the review:

- Disagreement with the definition used for on-treatment pregnancies  
- Disagreement with computation of "compressed cycles" excluding non-evaluable cycles  
- Inclusion of cycles of varying and inconsistent duration in efficacy analysis  

Agreement with the revised analysis (Table 14.2.41 from the March 7, 2016 submission). However, the revised analysis failed to meet the prespecified non-inferiority criterion, and insufficient evidence of efficacy was provided.

### Comments on Study Conduct

- Requirement for gel application no earlier than an hour before intercourse could result in a pregnancy rate not reflective of actual use. A range of acceptable dosing times should have been specified. The provided sensitivity analysis did not address this concern.  
- Avoiding classification of mild genitourinary symptoms lasting under one hour as adverse events limits understanding of expected side effects.  

### Recommended Action

A new non-inferiority trial is required:

- Compare Amphora to a nonoxynyl-9 gel  
- Majority of data should be from US populations  
- Foreign data must be generalizable to the US  
- Statistical analysis plan must be pre-specified and submitted prior to database lock  
- Include only cycles where subjects are at risk of pregnancy (evaluability criteria)  
- Ovulatory cycles must be well defined; exclude non-ovulatory cycles  

Further considerations:

- Collect detailed information (menstrual cycles, intercourse, use of study/alternate contraception)  
- Use electronic diaries to reduce missing/unreliable data

## Facility Inspections

Satisfactory resolution of deficiencies at the manufacturing facility is required for approval.

## Center for Devices and Radiological Health

### Device Description

1. Materials of the pre-filled applicator are inconsistently described throughout the submission. Confirm the final material used for the pre-filled applicator intended for use with Amphora gel.

### Biocompatibility

2. Instead of testing, historical data were referenced. However, discrepancies in material suppliers and lack of final product testing do not adequately demonstrate biocompatibility.  
   - Provide biocompatibility testing per ISO 10993  
   - Commercial use may be leveraged upon supportive data on product volume/use and adverse events  

3. Statements about food-contact compliance are insufficient.  
   - Biocompatibility testing per ISO 10993 should also be provided for the disposable applicator  

### Bench Testing

4. Wide range of values in separation force tests for applicators.  
   - Define minimum force required for disposable applicator filling  
   - Define maximum force for delivery for both applicators  

5. Condom compatibility testing was incomplete.  
   - Repeat ASTM D7661 testing using samples conditioned at 40°C for 60 minutes  

### Stability/Shelf Life

6. No assessment of applicator performance over shelf life.  
   - Include evaluation of key specifications: barrel/plunger friction and separation force  

7. Stability testing is incomplete. Additional information is required.

## Additional Comments

### Clinical

- In vitro study (Protocol EFM-COOO 1-GMPOO 16.00) tested Amphora interaction with other vaginal products at ~25°C. The applicability to body temperature conditions must be justified.

## Prescribing Information

Comments are reserved until adequacy is demonstrated.

- Review PLR and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule websites  
- Use **SRPI** checklist to confirm appropriate formatting  
- Submit updated content of labeling in SPL format:  
  [FDA SPL Guidance](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

## Carton and Container Labeling

Submit revised draft labeling as follows:

### A. Container Label (5 gram pre-filled applicators)

1. Update presentation to:  

   ```
   Amphora  
   (lactic acid, citric acid, and potassium bitartrate)  
   Vaginal Gel  
   1.76% / 1% / 0.4%
   ```

2. Add barcode in accordance with 21 CFR 201.25(c)(2)  
3. Relocate net quantity (e.g., “5 g”) away from "For Vaginal Use Only"

### B. Carton Labeling (5 gram pre-filled applicators)

1. See revisions in A.1 above  
2. Add intended NDC number for review  
3. Relocate net quantity to lower third of label  
4. Remove terminal zeros in percentage values (“1.00%” → “1%”, “0.40%” → “0.4%”)  
5. State the route of administration under Dosage and Administration  

---

## Proprietary Name

Refer to correspondence dated September 2, 2015. The name "Amphora" is acceptable pending application approval in the current cycle. Resubmit name with response.

## Safety Update (21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b))

Include the following in your safety update:

1. Describe significant changes in safety profile  
2. Include new safety data:  
   - Same format as original NDA  
   - Combined tabulations with previous data  
   - Comparative tables for adverse event frequencies  
   - Separate tables for other indications  

3. Retabulate reasons for trial discontinuation including new trial data  
4. Provide CRFs and narrative summaries for:  
   - Deaths during the trial  
   - Discontinuations due to adverse events  
   - Serious adverse events  

5. Describe any changes in incidence of common but non-serious adverse events  
6. Update exposure data (number of subjects, person-time)  
7. Provide worldwide safety experience and updated usage estimates  
8. Include English translations of current approved foreign labeling if not previously submitted
