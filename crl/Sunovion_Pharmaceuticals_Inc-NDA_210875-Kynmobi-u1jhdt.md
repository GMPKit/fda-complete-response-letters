### OTHER ACTION LETTERS

Silver Spring MD 20993  

**NDA 210875**  
**COMPLETE RESPONSE**

Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Attention: Sonya A. Roeloffzen  
Director, Global Regulatory Affairs  
84 Waterford Drive  
Marlborough, MA 01752  

Dear Ms. Roeloffzen,

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated March 29, 2018, received March 29, 2018, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Kynmobi (apomorphine) sublingual film 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, and 30 mg.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## HUMAN FACTORS (HF)

As communicated in the November 21, 2018, Discipline Review (DR) letter:

- The human factors (HF) validation study does not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the proposed product can be used safely and effectively by intended users for its intended uses and use environments.
- Several use errors and close calls occurred on critical tasks.
- Data has not demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed mitigations or that they do not introduce new risks.
- The HF study did not evaluate the final intend-to-market user interface.
- Thus, sufficient data has not been provided regarding whether intended users can open and close the packaging.

We acknowledge your December 7, 2018, formal response to the DR letter. However:

- The intend-to-market outer carton packaging was not part of the evaluated HF user interface.
- You proposed to submit a petition for exemption from child-resistant (CR) packaging requirements post-approval, but it's unclear whether the exemption will be granted.

### Specific Deficiencies

1. **Critical Task Errors and Labeling**  
   - Use errors and close calls were identified on critical tasks.
   - Revisions were made to the Instructions for Use (IFU) and film pouch (container label).
   - These revisions were not validated.
   - Evaluation of the label and labeling identified areas of vulnerability.
   - Some recommendations from the November 21, 2018, DR letter were implemented.

2. **Packaging Concerns**  
   - The packaging requires a push-pull technique.
   - This may be challenging for patients with Parkinson’s disease due to motor impairments during OFF periods.
   - Delays in therapy due to difficulty with packaging have consequences.
   - Users might alter or remove packaging, increasing risk of secondary exposure.

A human factors validation study using the intend-to-market user interface is needed. You should:

- Evaluate use-related errors observed in the HF study.
- Employ additional mitigation strategies.
- Update your use-related risk analysis.
- Submit your HF validation study protocol for feedback (optional, not required).

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY AND BIOPHARMACEUTICS

- Complete Study CTH-203 and provide the final report.
- Justify relevance of comparative data between Kynmobi and Apo-go to support reliance on FDA’s finding of safety for Apokyn.
- Clearly describe data supporting a scientific bridge between Kynmobi and Apokyn.

---

## SAFETY

- Oropharyngeal adverse events were observed with Kynmobi, reported under various terms.
- Occurred in over 25% of patients on Kynmobi (Study 300), compared to 4% on placebo.
- Also frequently observed in Study 301 and a common cause for discontinuation.

### Required Actions:

- Provide comprehensive discussion/summary including expert dermatological review.
- Reexamine safety database for both Study 300 and Study 301.
- Pool all oropharyngeal adverse events into clusters.
- Provide:
  - Number of events and unique patients.
  - Number of discontinuations.
  - Analyses by severity and study phase.
  - Analyses on timing, evolution, resolution, and relation to dose.
  - Analysis of association with systemic hypersensitivity.

- For ongoing Study CTH-301:
  - Refer all new affected patients to a qualified dermatologist.
  - Obtain and submit photographs and case summaries.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

Include a safety update per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b), covering:

1. Any significant changes/findings in safety profile.
2. Detailed discontinuation, serious and common adverse event data:
   - Present in same format as original.
   - Include both original and new data in combined tables.
   - Separate tables for non-proposed indications.
3. Retabulated discontinuation data from newly completed trials.
4. Case report forms and summaries for:
   - Trial deaths.
   - Adverse event discontinuations.
   - Serious adverse events.
5. Any substantial changes in incidence of common, less serious AEs.
6. Updated exposure data (subjects, person-time, etc.).
7. Summary of worldwide safety experience.
8. Translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS (Non-approvability Issues)

1. Conduct in vitro DDI studies for apomorphine glucuronide and norapomorphine glucuronide.
2. Submit updated ADaM datasets compliant with CDISC standards (e.g., consistent USUBJID).
3. Update Summary of Clinical Safety with analysis of events of special interest.
   - Include hypersensitivity and angioedema analyses.
4. Analyze exposure by self-reported dosing frequency in Studies 300 and 301.
5. Submit complete or interim report for open-label Study CTH-301.
6. In amended datasets, address blank EXDOSFRQ column in ADEX dataset:
   - Fill with 0–5 doses/day based on patient diaries.
   - Add DOSEON column and returned diary count per interval.

## OTHER

- Resubmit or take action under 21 CFR 314.110 within 1 year.
- Lack of response may be deemed as a request to withdraw under 21 CFR 314.65.
- May request extension if applicable.
