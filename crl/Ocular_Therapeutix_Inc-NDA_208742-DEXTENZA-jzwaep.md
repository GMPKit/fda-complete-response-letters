### Dear Dr. Ankerud:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received September 24, 2015, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for DEXTENZA (dexamethasone ophthalmic insert), 0.4 mg, for intracanalicular use.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated January 19, 2017, which constituted a complete response to our July 21, 2016, action letter.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated July 10, 2017, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## PRODUCT QUALITY / FACILITIES INSPECTION

The methods to be used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of the drug substance or the drug product must comply with the current good manufacturing practice regulations in 21 CFR 210 and 211.

During a recent inspection of the Ocular Therapeutix, Inc., FEI#3008477155, manufacturing facility for this application, our field investigators conveyed deficiencies to the representatives of this facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved.

For detailed information on these deficiencies, we refer you to the correspondence issued jointly by the New England District Office and the Office of Process and Facilities on July 10, 2017.

- Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI)

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the prescribing information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

---

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

These comments are not approvability issues:

1. The amendment dated June 13, 2016, includes updates to critical material attributes, critical in-process controls, and yield limits. Supporting test data for registration, stability, and proposed PQ batches were not provided. You referenced two batches (Lot No. 03241602 and 04211605, full unit scale) that were generated using the intended process. However, batch manufacturing records and in-process test results were not included. Provide this data to support that in-process materials and finished product meet quality requirements.  
2. The application lacks full information on scale-up strategy beyond the commercial scale. Submit any future scale-up as a Prior Approval Supplement (PAS), considering the complexity, custom equipment, and manual operations.

Partial responses will not be processed to begin a new review cycle.
