Dear Dr. Stagg,

Please refer to your Biologics License Application (BLA) dated and received May 15, 2017, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for botulinum toxin Type A injection.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated March 16, March 30, April 10, and May 2, 2018, which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of these amendments by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

### General

1. We received unsolicited information in various amendments that you submitted during the BLA review cycle. We have not fully determined the extent of the unsolicited changes made to the BLA at this time.  
   Examples of these changes include:  
   - Process validation data from three new drug product (DP) lots manufactured with an updated commercial DP manufacturing process in an amendment received on December 15, 2017.  
   - Changes to the DP post-approval stability protocol to eliminate testing time points in an amendment received on December 1, 2017.

   To facilitate assessment of the impact of the changes made to the BLA on the approvability of your BLA, provide a list of all the unsolicited information and changes added to the BLA after the initial BLA receipt on May 15, 2017.

16. Evaluate the effect of hold time on endotoxin detection by spiking a known amount of standard endotoxin (RSE or purified CSE) into undiluted DP and test for recoverable endotoxin over time using the USP <85> Bacterial Endotoxin Test (BET). Submit the report in the BLA resubmission.

16. You did not routinely monitor bioburden to verify continued microbial control of the drug product.  
   - Implement routine bioburden monitoring.  
   - Provide a description of the bioburden test method and include method qualification, summary data, and the qualification report.

### Product Quality: Drug Substance and Drug Product

17. Reference materials play a critical role in confirming the suitability of analytical tests and the quality of the product during release and stability testing. Information in the BLA suggests your DS reference material management program does not generate sufficient quantities of a given reference material lot to support all required testing.  
   - Revise your reference material qualification procedures to ensure sufficient reference material is generated for all necessary testing, including qualification of future reference materials.  
   - Revise the DS reference material qualification and requalification protocol to include adequate stability monitoring.

18. In your December 1, 2017, response to the November 13, 2017, information request to update the DP stability testing protocols to include DP reconstitution time, it appears that additional changes were made to the post-approval stability protocol originally submitted in the BLA to remove the testing points at 3, 6, 9, and 18 months.  
   - You did not provide sufficient stability data to support a reduced stability testing program.  
   - Revise your annual stability protocol to include testing at 3, 6, 9, and 18 months as recommended by ICH Q5C guidelines.

19. In your March 9, 2018, response to the March 2, 2018, information request regarding Evolus’ role in DWP-450 lot release, you stated that some of Evolus’ quality responsibilities will be delegated via quality agreements and SOPs to your “soon to be established distributor.”  
   - Your response indicates the distributor may be responsible for:
     - Visual inspection for shipping or water damage
     - Verification of release certifications (Certificate of Analysis) from Daewoong Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.
     - Verification of shipment quantity and lot numbers
     - Verification that appropriate temperature was maintained during shipment  
   - You stated you will rely on the distributor’s SOPs and QA unit for these activities.

   If your distributor performs release operations for Evolus, they may fit the definition of a manufacturer rather than a distributor per 21 CFR 600.3 (t), (u), and (aa), and should be listed as a manufacturer in the license application.

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Please refer to correspondence dated September 27, 2017, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Jeuveau. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update. The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. For discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables comparing frequencies of adverse events in the original application with updated frequencies.
   - For other indications, provide separate tables for adverse event frequencies.

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation incorporating data from newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for:
   - Each patient who died during a clinical trial
   - Each patient who discontinued due to an adverse event
   - All serious adverse events

5. Describe any information suggesting a substantial change in common but less serious adverse events between new and original data.

6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person-time).

7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on this product’s safety, including updated usage estimates in other countries.

8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.
