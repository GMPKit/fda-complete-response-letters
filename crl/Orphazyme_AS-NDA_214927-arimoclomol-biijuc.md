Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated July 17, 2020, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for arimoclomol capsules.

We acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated December 22, 2020, which extended the goal date by three months.

We have completed our review of this application and determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. Our reasons and recommendations are outlined below.

## TRIAL NPC-002

### Primary Efficacy Results

- We have concerns with your hypothetical estimand used in your primary efficacy analysis for the 5DNPCCSS endpoint.
  - Treatment difference: -1.4 points (95% CI: -2.8, 0.0; p=0.046)
  - Not clinically plausible for hypothetical scores post-premature termination
- Main efficacy evaluation focused on **while-on-treatment estimand**
  - Estimated treatment difference: -1.2 (95% CI: -2.7, 0.3; p=0.12)
  - Not statistically significant
- Concerns with 5DNPCCSS:

### 5DNPCCSS Regulatory History

- **Sept 2, 2016** and **Jan 19, 2017**: Noted domains of NPCCSS were not well-defined or sensitive to change
- Repeated requests made for:
  - Standardized performance-based assessments
  - Evidence of domain reliability
- **July 20, 2017 & July 10, 2019**: Validity of each domain and scoring inadequacies reiterated

### 5DNPCCSS Validity Concerns

- Lack of comparison with validated measures except for ASHA-NOMS and PAS
- Swallow domain concerns:
  - Same score given for clinically different presentations
  - Ambiguities regarding severity progression
  - Potential biases due to baseline imbalances between treatment arms
  - Questionable relevance of improvements due to construct-irrelevant variance
- NIH natural history study shows poor alignment with NPCCSS
- Other domain concerns:
  - Ambulation — retroactive scoring
  - Cognition — reflects environment, not just drug effect
  - Fine motor — unclear scoring between levels of dysmetria

---

## CONFIRMATORY EVIDENCE

- **In vitro studies**:
  - NPC1 protein increased at 50–400 μM — 16x–130x higher than clinical plasma concentrations
  - Clinical relevance is unclear
- **Animal studies** (Npc-/- mouse model):
  - Inconsistent findings between GLP and non-GLP studies
  - Paradoxical dose responses
  - No survival improvement in GLP study

- **Peer-reviewed publication** by Kirkegaard et al included — unclear how findings related to submitted data

- **Trial NPC-002 biomarkers**:
  - Only Lyso-SM-509 showed a significant effect at 6 months, not sustained at 12 months
  - HSP70 increased in both arimoclomol and placebo arms
  - Other biomarkers: Non-significant changes and high variability
  - LC-MS/MS assay for Lyso-SM-509 not fully validated

---

## CONCLUSION

Current data **do not meet the evidentiary standard for substantial evidence of effectiveness**, due to:
- Weak confirmatory evidence
- Validity concerns with 5DNPCCSS
- Small, statistically nonsignificant treatment effect (p=0.12)

---

## INFORMATION NEEDED TO RESOLVE THE DEFICIENCIES

1. **Address issues with 5DNPCCSS**:
   - (a) Potential for rescoring domain scores  
   - (b) Align NPCCSS swallow scores with ASHA-NOMS and PAS  
   - (c) Impact of potential score bias (toward/away from null)

2. **Provide additional evidence**:
   - Quantitative/qualitative validation of scoring (e.g., interviews with clinical experts)  
   - Use performance-based/clinician-reported measures longitudinally with 5DNPCCSS

3. **Provide additional analyses from Trial NPC-002**:
   - Skin biopsy data (baseline, month 6, month 12)  
   - Correlation with Global Impression of Change  
   - Subgroup analysis data (e.g., double-null mutations, interaction with miglustat)

4. **Bolster confirmatory evidence of effectiveness**:
   - Cross-over pharmacodynamic study with validated biomarkers  
   - Further data from biomarkers (e.g., HSP70, Lyso-SM-509) or skin biopsies

## ADVISORY COMMITTEE

Application may require discussion at an advisory committee meeting in the next review cycle.

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

- **Indication request**: Trial NPC-002 included NPC Type 1 patients only, but application seeks approval for both Type 1 and Type 2.  
  - Provide justification for including NPC Type 2.
