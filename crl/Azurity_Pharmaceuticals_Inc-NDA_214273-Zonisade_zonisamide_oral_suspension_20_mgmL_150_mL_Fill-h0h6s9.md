Dear Dr. Devarakonda:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated July 29, 2020, received July 29, 2020, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Zonisade (zonisamide) oral suspension, 20 mg/mL, 150 mL Fill.

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

1. During a recent inspection of the manufacturing facility for this application, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved.

2. During a review of records requested under Section 704(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, we communicated issues with the L M MANUFACTURING LIMITED, FEI 3015337531 manufacturing facility named in your application. These issues will need to be addressed for your application to be approved. An inspection of the L M MANUFACTURING LIMITED, FEI 3015337531 facility is required before the application can be approved.

    - FDA must ensure that the facility is able to conduct the listed manufacturing operations in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations.
    - Due to restrictions on travel, we were unable to conduct an inspection during the current review cycle.
    - You may respond to deficiencies in this Complete Response Letter while the travel restrictions remain in effect.
    - However, even if these deficiencies are addressed, the application cannot be approved until the required FDA inspection is conducted and any findings are assessed.
    - We will continue to monitor the public health situation and travel restrictions.
    - We are actively working to define an approach for scheduling outstanding inspections, once safe travel may resume and based on public health need and other factors.

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.
