## Facility Inspections Major Deficiencies

- Observed objectionable conditions at Biocon Sdn. Bhd. FEI#3011248248.
- Approval of the NDA contingent on satisfactory resolution of these observations.
- Facility has been cited previously in earlier complete response.

---

## Prescribing Information

Your proposed Prescribing Information (PI) must conform to:

- **21 CFR 201.56(a) and (d)**  
- **21 CFR 201.57**

### Labeling Review Resources:

- [Physician Labeling Rule Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)
- Regulations and guidance documents
- Sample tool for format: Highlights and Contents
- Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) checklist
- FDA’s established pharmacologic class (EPC) text phrases

### Labeling Issues in IFU:

1. **Step 8 title revised to “Step 8 Needle disposal”**  
   - Ensure consistent reference across IFU, e.g. change instances of “See Step 8 at the end” to “See Step 8 Needle disposal”.

2. **Sub-bullet formatting**  
   - IFU revised to use bullets instead of A, B, C → Considered a major change. Revert to original lettered bullets per Human Factors validation.

3. Prior to resubmission:
   - Use SRPI checklist to correct formatting
   - Submit content in Structured Product Labeling (SPL) format as per FDA guidelines
   - Provide both marked-up and clean Word versions with change annotations

---

## Carton and Container Labeling

- Submit draft labeling identical to August 28, 2019 version (Pen & Vial presentations)

---

## Proprietary Name

- "Semglee" found conditionally acceptable (May 1, 2019 communication)
- Must be resubmitted with response

---

## Safety Update

Include under **21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b)**:

1. Detailed description of safety profile changes  
2. Adverse Event data:  
   - Include new findings alongside original  
   - Compare event frequencies  
   - Submit separate tabulations for other indications  

3. Retabulated reasons for premature discontinuations  
4. Case report forms and narrative summaries:  
   - Deaths  
   - Discontinuations due to AEs  
5. Note changes in common, less serious AEs  
6. Updated exposure data (subjects, total exposure)  
7. Summary of worldwide usage/safety experience  
8. English translation of current foreign labels not previously submitted  

---

## Clinical-Related Major Deficiencies

1. **Manufacturing Process Change (Process V to VI):**  
   - Process VI used for product to be marketed, clinical trials used Process V.  
   - Needed: Additional bridging data on safety, efficacy, especially immunogenicity.

2. **Bridging Data for Vial Presentation:**  
   - Required: PK/PD study (Study MYL-1501D-1004)

---

## Product Quality-Related Major Deficiencies

3. **Biocon Facility (FEI#3011248248):**  
   - FDA observed objectionable conditions during inspection.

4. **CMC Microbiology Deficiencies:**  
   - Missing method suitability data (endotoxin, sterility, AET)  
   - Lack of AET data for expiry period

### Required for Resubmission:

- AET results for 10 mL DP with lowest polysorbate 20 content  
- Commitment for AET on at least one stability batch per presentation  
- Submission of actual endotoxin and sterility method suitability reports

---

## Human Factors-Related Major Deficiencies

5. **Insufficient Pediatric Users:**  
   - Fewer than required untrained, injection-naïve pediatric patients  
   - Revised IFU requires new validation study with 15 pediatric naive users

6. **Product Differentiation Failures:**  
   - Carton/Container Labeling contributed to confusion  
   - After label changes, conduct another differentiation study with 15 users per user group  
   - Prefer submitting protocols to FDA before beginning new HF studies

---

## Prescribing Information Revision Requests

### Section 2 Dosage and Administration:

1. Add "upper arm" and "buttocks" to administration sites  
2. Add caution on vision-impaired patients  
3. Note 1-unit increment dialing for pen  
4. Reinstate statement on switching from NPH insulin  
5. Temperature: list **Fahrenheit before Celsius**

---

## Instructions for Use (IFU) – Revision Guidance

1. Clarify total units, steps of 1, and dosing over 80 units  
2. Restructure incomplete disposal reminders  
3. Structure the "Storage" section with bullet points  
4. Add specific guidance under Step 4 (dose dialing)  
5. Revise Step 5 (site selection instructions)  
6. Clarify injection holding instructions under Step 6

---

## Carton and Container Labeling – Revision Guidance

### Pen Container Label:

- Improve readability of:
  - Proprietary, established names and strength  
  - Rx only statements  
  - "For Single Patient Use Only"

### Vial Container Label:

- Improve readability of:
  - Strength (100 units/mL)  
  - Rx only

### Carton (Pen & Vial):

- Revise:
  - Placement and legibility of strength  
  - Rx only text and font  
  - Update usage/disposal instructions placement and clarity
