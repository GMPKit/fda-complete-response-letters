### PRODUCT QUALITY

1. Your data demonstrate that the drug product solution is incompatible with the proposed commercial borosilicate glass vials. The data provided in support of the compatibility of the alternative aluminosilicate glass vials are incomplete and ambiguous. Glass containers are generally incompatible with highly alkaline solutions. To resolve this deficiency, provide a comprehensive study report with unambiguous data and fully validated methods to demonstrate the compatibility of the drug product solution with your proposed primary container closure system.

2. The information request response dated December 29, 2021, regarding Container Closure Integrity Testing (CCIT) is acknowledged. Additional information is needed to assess acceptability of aluminosilicate vials:

   a. Provide the spectrophotometric data with all results from the CCIT dye ingress studies reported to be performed with 20 intact vials from each of three batches GB2007B, GB2008B, and GB2009B.

   b. Provide details of the CCIT protocol including the study date. Confirm dye ingress CCIT was conducted using units exposed to worst-case conditions prior to testing. Confirm both pressure and vacuum conditions were applied during CCIT. If not, submit a new CCIT meeting these conditions.

### PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

1. Comment on the proposed labeling is reserved until the application is otherwise adequate. Review labeling resources on the following FDA websites:

   - [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)
   - [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

   Use the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) checklist, and include updated content of labeling (21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)) in Structured Product Labeling (SPL) format as described at [FDA SPL](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).
