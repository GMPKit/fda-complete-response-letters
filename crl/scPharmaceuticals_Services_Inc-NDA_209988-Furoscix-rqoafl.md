# COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER  
**Application Number:** NDA 209988  
**Sponsor:** scPharmaceuticals Services, Inc.  
**Product:** Furoscix™ (Furosemide) 80 mg/10 mL, Drug-device combination product

## DEVICE

1. **Device Changes During Review Cycle**  
   - Changes made to device design and software parameters without prior FDA knowledge.  
   - Submission must include the finalized to-be-marketed device.  
   - Clearly state if testing was performed on previous versions and justify their relevance.

2. **Master Access File (MAF) Deficiencies**  
   - Device documentation relies heavily on MAF.  
   - Outstanding deficiencies have been separately communicated to MAF Holder.  
   - Recommendations:  
     a. Work with MAF Holder to resolve deficiencies  
     b. Resubmit NDA only after resolution

---

## BIOCOMPATIBILITY

4. **Clarify Testing Method**  
   - Report "device-rpt-0351" references USP <788> without stating Method 1 or 2  
   - Specify method or conduct testing under Method 1 Light Obscuration

5. **Cytotoxicity Evaluation Method**  
   - Report inconsistencies in cytotoxicity test methods between Table 7 and "device-rpt-0352"  
   - Clarify used method and provide justification

---

## CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION

6. **Clinically Relevant Conditions**  
   - Sample preparation in leachables report unclear if done under clinically relevant conditions  
   - Clarify or provide new test under real-use conditions

7. **Detection of Volatile/Semi-Volatile Compounds**  
   - GC/MS spike recoveries used, but detection adequacy is unclear  
   - Provide rationale or new testing using appropriate methods

---

## ELECTRICAL SAFETY AND EMC

8. **Inadequate Labeling for EMC**  
   - Update labeling as per IEC 60601-1-2:2014  
     a. EMC Warning Distance Statement  
     b. Essential performance information  
     c. Battery specifications

---

## LABELING

9. **Labeling Not Updated as Committed**  
   - Include content warnings and relevant safety symbols  
   - Ensure alignment with guidance documents:

     - [Infusion Pumps Total Product Life Cycle (2014)](https://www.fda.gov/media/78369/download)

10. **Insufficient Labeling Evidence for Claim**  
    - Clarify scenarios of clinic/home application with supporting evidence  
    - Update Instructions for Use (IFU)

---

## HUMAN FACTORS

11. **Risk Not Addressed for Certain Patient Conditions**  
    - Exclusion criteria from adhesive effectiveness study not reflected in use-related risk analysis  
    - Assess clinical risks, update IFU and PI accordingly

12. **HF Validation Not Conducted with Final Design**  
    - Conduct comprehensive use-related risk analysis  
    - Determine HF validation test requirements  
    - Submit protocol for FDA review (optional)

---

## SOFTWARE/CYBERSECURITY

13. **Incomplete Safety Assurance Case**  
    - Missing alarm/error information

      a. Reliability specs  
      b. Code coverage for static testing

---

## ENGINEERING / PERFORMANCE / RISK

14. **Fluid Ingress Justification Inadequate**  
    - Provide ingress testing and appropriate labeling  

15. **Alarm Trigger Limits Not Provided**  
    - Submit specific trigger thresholds with verification testing

16. **Error Notification Timing**  
    - Redesign device to notify users promptly or provide clinical rationale  

---

18. **No Traceability Between Hazards and Testing**  
    - Submit Design Verification and Validation (DVV) Plan that traces hazards to testing

19. **Inadequate Requirement Specifications**  
    - Scientific rationale required for all specifications

### Verification/Validation of Design

20. **Lack of Evidence for Conformity to Standards**  
    - Follow guidance: [Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards](https://www.fda.gov/media/71983/download)

21. **Insufficient Verification and Validation Plan**  
    - Provide detail: sampling plan, statistical methods, aging plan, and current test reports  
    - Clearly state if the test sample is the to-be-marketed device  
    - Confirm evidence supports all essential performance requirements

22. **Test Reports Do Not Meet FDA Guidance**  
    - Follow: [Recommended Content for Non-Clinical Bench Testing](https://www.fda.gov/media/113230/download)  
    - Provide objective evidence with conclusions aligned to design specs

### Risk Mitigations

23. **Lack of Clear Risk-Mitigations Tracing**  
    - Connect risks, hazards, and mitigations in SAC
