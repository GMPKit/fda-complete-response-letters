# CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH

## APPLICATION NUMBER: 210875Orig1s000  
## OTHER ACTION LETTERS  

**DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES**  
Food and Drug Administration  
Silver Spring, MD 20993  

**NDA 210875 - COMPLETE RESPONSE**  
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Attention: Sonya A. Roeloffzen  
Director, Global Regulatory Affairs  
84 Waterford Drive  
Marlborough, MA 01752  

Dear Ms. Roeloffzen:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated March 29, 2018, received March 29, 2018, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Kynmobi (apomorphine) sublingual film 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, and 30 mg.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## HUMAN FACTORS (HF)

As communicated in the November 21, 2018, Discipline Review (DR) letter, the human factors (HF) validation study for Kynmobi does not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate safe and effective use by intended users for its intended uses and use environments. Key issues include:

- Several use errors and close calls on critical tasks were identified.
- Lack of data showing proposed mitigations are effective and safe.
- Failure to evaluate the final intend-to-market user interface, i.e., proposed packaging.

We acknowledge your December 7, 2018, response and your plans to address concerns, as well as your evaluation of the product in the clinical setting.

However:

- The intend-to-market outer carton packaging was not included in the HF validation study.
- Proposed plans to submit a petition for exemption from CR packaging requirement may not succeed.

### Specific HF Deficiencies Identified:

1. Study results showed use errors/close calls on critical tasks. Though revisions were made to the IFU and container label, these were not validated. Evaluation of the proposed user interface, label, and labeling revealed vulnerabilities that may lead to medication errors.

2. The current packaging requires a push-pull technique that may be difficult for patients with Parkinson’s disease during OFF periods. Difficulties in opening/closing could result in permanent removal of foil pouches and altering CR features, increasing exposure risks.

Since the packaging was excluded from HF testing and the intended population may experience difficulty with packaging, current HF data are not representative.

### Required Action:

Conduct a human factors validation study using the intend-to-market user interface. Prior to the study:

- Reevaluate observed use-related errors
- Employ additional mitigation strategies
- Update use-related risk analysis

We recommend submitting your HF validation study protocol for FDA feedback prior to study commencement.

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY AND BIOPHARMACEUTICS

- Complete Study CTH-203 and provide the final report.
- Justify the scientific bridge between Kynmobi and Apo-go to support reliance on FDA’s finding of safety for Apokyn.
- Include data demonstrating the bridge between Kynmobi and Apo-go, and between Apokyn and Apo-go.

## SAFETY

Oropharyngeal adverse events were not adequately characterized. Events include but are not limited to:

- Oropharyngeal pain/swelling, pharyngeal erythema, gingivitis, oral pain, lip swelling, oral mucosal erythema, stomatitis, dysgeusia, glossodynia, leukoplakia oral, oral allergy syndrome, pharyngeal edema.

Findings:

- >25% of Kynmobi-treated patients in Study 300 reported oropharyngeal AEs, vs. 4% on placebo.
- Oropharyngeal AEs also common in Study 301 and contributed to discontinuations.

### Required Actions:

- Provide a comprehensive discussion and expert dermatologist review.
- Reexamine safety database for Studies 300 and 301.
- Pool oropharyngeal AEs into clusters (e.g., edema, pain).
- Provide:
  - Number of events and unique patient counts
  - Number of discontinuations
  - Severity-based analysis
  - Per-study phase analysis (titration / maintenance)
  - Time-to-onset and resolution analyses
  - Dose relationship
  - Systemic hypersensitivity association

- In Study CTH-301:
  - Refer patients with new AEs to dermatologists
  - Obtain diagnosis, investigator assessment, case summary, photographs

## SAFETY UPDATE

Include a safety update per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b), covering all nonclinical and clinical trials:

1. Describe any significant findings or changes in the safety profile.
2. Present updated safety data:
   - Same format as original
   - Combined with original submission data
   - Frequency comparison tables
   - Separate safety tables for non-proposed indications
3. Retabulate all reasons for early trial discontinuation.
4. Submit:
   - Case report forms
   - Narrative summaries for deaths and SAEs
5. Describe changes in common adverse event incidence.
6. Provide updated clinical exposure data (e.g., subject counts, person time).
7. Provide summary of worldwide safety experience.
8. Submit English translations of any foreign labeling not yet included.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

(Not approvability issues)

1. Conduct in vitro drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies for apomorphine glucuronide and norapomorphine glucuronide.
2. Submit new ADaM datasets compliant with CDISC; ensure consistent use of USUBJID identifier.
3. Update Summary of Clinical Safety for adverse events of special interest. Analyze by dose and exposure duration for hypersensitivity cases (e.g., MedDRA SMQ).
4. Analyze APL-130277 exposure based on self-reported frequency in Studies 300 and 301.
5. Submit completed or interim report for open-label Study CTH-301 if ongoing.
6. In the 120-day safety update:
   - Populate EXDOSFRQ (dosing frequency) in ADEX dataset from patient diaries.
   - Add DOSEON column for prescribed dose.
   - Add column for daily diary returns per interval.
