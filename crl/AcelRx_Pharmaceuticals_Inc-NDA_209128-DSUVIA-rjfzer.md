**APPLICATION NUMBER:** 209128Orig1s000  
**OTHER ACTION LETTERS**

## DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES  
Food and Drug Administration  
Silver Spring, MD 20993  

**NDA 209128**  
**COMPLETE RESPONSE**  

AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
351 Galveston Drive  
Redwood City, CA 94063  

Attention: Kimberly Gaumer  
Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance  

---

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received December 12, 2016, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) for DSUVIA (sufentanil sublingual tablet).

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## SAFETY

The safety database, while suitable in number of patients, did not contain a sufficient number of patients dosed at the maximum amount described in the proposed labeling to assess the safety of DSUVIA. This is particularly important as there is a nearly 4-fold increase in the exposure and a more than 2-fold increase in the maximum concentration when DSUVIA is dosed at steady state.

To address this deficiency:

- Collect additional data in at least 50 patients with postoperative pain sufficient to evaluate the safety of DSUVIA for a period following the maximum dosing proposed.

---

## HUMAN FACTORS

We have determined that the human factors (HF) validation study data did not demonstrate that the user interface supports safe and effective use of the product by intended users for intended uses and environments. Failures that result in dropped sufentanil tablets pose a risk for accidental exposure, improper dosing, and diversion. Overall, we do not find the risk acceptable and note that you did not propose any additional measures to further mitigate the risk.

To address this deficiency:

- Develop mitigation strategies to address the risk of dropped sufentanil tablets.
- Conduct another HF validation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the recommended mitigation strategies in addressing the use-related errors observed in your validation study and to ensure that the changes do not introduce new risks.

We recommend incorporating the following changes to the user interface:

### A. Directions for Use (DFU)

1. Revise step 6 of the DFU to split into two steps:

    ```
    Step 6: Depress the green Pusher to deliver the tablet to the patient’s sublingual space.  
    Step 7: Visually confirm tablet placement in the sublingual space.
    ```

2. Modify the figures that depict the patient’s mouth by labeling parts of the mouth so they represent a more accurate representation of human anatomy. Labeling parts of the mouth within the graphics will help guide users in the proper administration technique.

3. Label each figure (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 2) in the DFU and refer to the figures within the written instructions (e.g., “see Figure 1”).

### B. Pouch Package

1. Replace the simplified graphics on the back of the foil pouch with the complete DFU (written instruction with revised and labeled graphics), such that complete DFU cannot be easily separated from the foil packet prior to use or discarded along with the carton.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) — a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the prescribing information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances.

Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

<http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm>

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Please refer to correspondence dated March 30, 2017, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, DSUVIA. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

## RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY REQUIREMENTS

Section 505-1 of the FDCA authorizes FDA to require the submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) if FDA determines that such a strategy is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks [section 505-1(a)].

We acknowledge receipt of your proposed REMS, included in your submission dated December 12, 2016, which contains elements to assure safe use, an implementation system, and a timetable for submission of assessments of the REMS.

In accordance with section 505-1 of the FDCA, we agree that a REMS will be necessary for DSUVIA (sufentanil sublingual tablet), if it is approved, to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risk of respiratory depression resulting from accidental exposure.

The REMS, should it be approved, will create enforceable obligations. We will continue discussion of your proposed REMS after your complete response to this action letter has been submitted.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables.
3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating drop-outs from newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for:
   - Each patient who died during a clinical trial
   - Patients who did not complete a trial due to an adverse event
   - Serious adverse events
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common but less serious adverse events.
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug, including an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## CONTAINER LABEL AND CARTON LABELING COMMENTS

We reserve final comment on the proposed container label and carton labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. The following comments are being shared for your consideration:

### A. Single Dose Applicator Container Label

In accordance with 21 CFR 201.10(i), the label must include:

1. Proprietary name  
2. Established name  
3. Lot or control number  
4. Name of manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug  

Additionally, we recommend including the expiration date.

### B. Pouch Labeling - Front

1. To improve readability, consider alternative presentation for proprietary name. Recommend presenting “DSUVIA” in the same color without intervening matter.
2. If room permits, consider adding the statements:
   - “Instruct the patient to not chew or swallow the tablet.”
   - “Instruct the patient to not eat or drink and minimize talking for 10 minutes after receiving the tablet.”

### C. Pouch Labeling - Back

1. Revise the statement to read: “Administration Information” to more accurately reflect the information that follows.
2. Modify the figures of the patient’s mouth by labeling parts of the mouth to represent a more accurate illustration of human anatomy.

### D. Carton Labeling

To improve readability, consider presenting “DSUVIA” in the same color without intervening matter.
