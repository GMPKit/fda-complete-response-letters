## COMPLETE RESPONSE  

Azurity Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
**Attention:** Justin Kilby  
Associate Director, Regulatory Affairs  
8 Cabot Road, Suite 2000  
Woburn, MA 01801  

Dear Justin Kilby:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received January 04, 2024, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for sitagliptin oral solution.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated October 28, 2024, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

1. Following inspection of the facility listed in this application, FDA conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. The facility should provide satisfactory responses to these deficiencies to the FDA office indicated on the FDA 483 prior to your complete response. The facility’s satisfactory responses are dependent on FDA’s determination that the facility has come into compliance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) and may require re-inspection of the facility.

2. The deficiencies identified during the inspection may not be specific to your application. Therefore, you should coordinate with the facility for timely resolution. Your complete response should include the date(s) of the facility’s response(s) to the FDA Form 483.

3. Please refer to Compliance Program CP 7356.002 for guidance on post inspection activities.

4. Following resolution of the CGMP inspection, FDA may need to conduct a pre-approval inspection (PAI) of the facility. Satisfactory outcomes of both the PAI and the CGMP surveillance inspections will be needed prior to an approval of the application.

> As the applicant, we do not expect a response to this facility-related deficiency. Instead, please work with the facility, as applicable, in resolving the related deficiencies.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources) and [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule) websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) − a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at [FDA SPL](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Please refer to correspondence dated April 03, 2024, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, **Brynovin**. This name was found conditionally acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to all of the application deficiencies that have been identified in this letter.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:

   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described in the bullet above.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each subject who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.

8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. You may also request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial response to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your meeting request as described in the draft guidance for industry *Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products*.

The product may not be legally marketed until you have been notified in writing that this application is approved.

If you have any questions, contact:
