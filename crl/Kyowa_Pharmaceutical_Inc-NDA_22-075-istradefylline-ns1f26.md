Dear Dr. Bloss:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated March 29, 2007, received April 25, 2007, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for (istradefylline) tablets 20mg and 40mg.

We have completed our review and find the information presented is inadequate. Therefore, the application is not approvable under section 505(d) of the Act and 21 CFR 314.125(b). The deficiencies are summarized as follows:

## CLINICAL

We acknowledge that you have submitted three well-controlled studies (Studies 005, 006, and 013) that show effectiveness for the adjunctive use of istradefylline 20mg, 40mg, and 60mg/day (without clear evidence of dose response) in decreasing the percent of time awake spent in the OFF state in patients with advanced Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Several other well-controlled studies of adequate size, however, do not show such an effect, and in one of those studies, Study EU-007, an active control, entacapone, gave an almost significant result (p=0.06) while istradefylline showed essentially no effect. Entacapone, moreover, had a favorable effect on the PGI, a patient-rated global measure in that study, while istradefylline did not.

These findings, taken together, establish effectiveness in decreasing OFF time, but raise questions about the strength of the finding.

A more important problem, raising the critical question of what patients should receive istradefylline, is raised by the uniform failure of the trials to find any other result that supports the clinical utility of istradefylline or suggests meaningful benefit to patients.

There are no nominally significant between-treatment contrasts favoring istradefylline compared to placebo on any secondary outcomes in any of the trials, including those assessing other symptoms of PD (e.g., UPDRS, ON time) or global measures of functioning (e.g., CGI, SF-36). These results are conspicuous, compared to all other recently approved treatments for advanced PD, for the absolute lack of demonstrable effect on these other measures.

We acknowledge that there is no requirement under law that a new drug be as good as other available treatments, but any inferiority should not represent a risk to patients. Parkinson’s Disease is a serious disease, and effective symptomatic treatment can prevent serious clinical outcomes (e.g., falls), even if the treatment has no effect on the underlying progression of the illness.

Although cross-study comparisons are typically unreliable, in this case we believe that the totality of the evidence justifies our concerns. In Study EU-007, which included an active comparator (entacapone), entacapone showed an effect on the PGI, while istradefylline did not.

The lack of effect is further supported by the lack of a statistically significant change in UPDRS, CGS, and PGI scores in the double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 051) examining istradefylline 40mg as monotherapy.

It is possible that this class of compounds improves OFF time with no effect on other PD symptoms. However, even if this were true, we would still expect an improvement on non-specific global and/or quality of life measures, especially those rated by patients. The complete lack of such improvement across multiple studies and measures suggests that:

- The effect seen on OFF time is inconsistent or clinically trivial  
- Some drug effects are distressing enough for patients to judge no benefit

These data lead us to conclude that there appears to be no population for whom istradefylline would be a suitable choice and, therefore, we cannot support its approval at this time.

However, we believe that with additional data, approval could be supported.

Specifically, if you were to demonstrate, in an adequately designed and conducted controlled trial, that patients with advanced PD — who had been explicitly maximally and optimally treated with all appropriate available treatments — had a decrease in OFF time on istradefylline compared to placebo, this might support approval of the application.

We would be happy to work with you to design such a study.

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

If you wish to pursue approval in the future, the following Phase 4 commitments would be required:

1. A drug interaction study to investigate the inhibition potential of istradefylline on Pgp.  
2. In vitro studies to explore the induction potential of istradefylline on CYP1A2.  
   - If there is such a potential, an in vivo study may be necessary.

## NONCLINICAL

Mineralization in the brain was first detected in the 2-year carcinogenicity study in the rat.

As requested by the Agency (cf. minutes of End-of-Phase 2 Meeting, September 23, 2003), you re-examined brains from other toxicity studies in rat and dog and from the 2-year mouse study.

For the 4-, 13-, and 26-week studies in rat and the 2-year mouse study, you:

- Re-examined brains including cutting additional sections  
- Used various stains (e.g., PAS, von Kossa, alizarin red)

Findings:

- Dose-related incidence of foci of mineralization in 13- and 26-week rat studies  
- No findings in 2-year mouse study

It is not clear that similar techniques were used to re-examine brains from subchronic and chronic dog studies.

Problems identified:

- No overall summary of methodology and results of original/re-examination  
- No expert opinions on the mineralization and its drug relationship  
- Relevant data located in dispersed files without proper labeling by study title — only by number  
- Pivotal studies had multiple identifiers and lacked cross-referencing

**Required:**  
- Provide an overall summary as described  
- If expanded histopathology of dog brains was not conducted (as done in rat and mouse), conduct it and submit results

## NEXT STEPS

Within 10 days after the date of this letter, you are required to:

- Amend the application  
- Notify us of your intent to file an amendment  
- Or follow one of your other options under 21 CFR 314.120

If none are followed, we will consider your lack of response as a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65.

- Any amendment should respond to all deficiencies listed  
- We will not process a partial reply as a major amendment  
- The review clock will not re-start until all deficiencies are addressed

Under 21 CFR 314.102(d), you may request a meeting or telephone conference with this division to discuss what steps are needed for approval.

The drug product may not be legally marketed until you are notified in writing that the application is approved.
