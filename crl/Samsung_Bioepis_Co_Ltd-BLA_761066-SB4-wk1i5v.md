Dear Ms. Boyle,

Please refer to your Biologics License Application (BLA) dated May 25, 2017, received May 25, 2017, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for SB4.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

1. The data and information provided in your response on January 12 and February 14, 2018, to the Agency’s information requests (IRs) dated December 19, 2017 (IR #13), and February 7, 2018 (IR #1) demonstrate that:
    - The primary reference standard (PRS) was not appropriately qualified with respect to biological activity (TNF-α binding activity and TNF-α neutralization activity) and protein concentration, and therefore is not appropriate for its intended use.
    - Because the PRS was not appropriately qualified, the working reference standard (WRS), which was qualified against the PRS, is also not appropriate for its intended use.
    - Therefore, there is a lack of assurance that the commercial materials are not going to drift from SB4 clinical materials and the materials used to establish the analytical similarity.

    a. Generate an appropriately qualified reference material based on the advice provided in the Agency’s IRs dated December 19, 2017, and February 7, 2018.  
       Upon generation of the new qualified reference material, provide data to adequately link this material to the materials used in the clinical studies and analytical similarity assessment.  
       We recommend using a two-tiered system for utilizing reference standard material for routine testing of commercial product.

    b. Clearly define the actions taken when samples are outside the rejection/action limit; these should include activities such as segregation of the portion of the lot associated with the out-of-range sample(s).

2. The information and data provided to support the commercial drug product shipping do not provide sufficient assurance that the quality of the DP is maintained during commercial shipping and distribution:
    - The air transport simulation study parameters tested are not representative of routine distribution conditions and cannot be used in lieu of real-time DP shipping validation studies.
    - It is unclear how the supply chain cycling study (Section 3.2.P.8.1) supports the validation of drug product shipping from either DP manufacturing site.

    Provide:
    - Shipping validation data from real-time or sufficiently representative studies.
    - Pre- and post-shipping product quality assessment.
    - A detailed description of the study methods.
    - Justification if using simulation studies.

3. As requested in an IR dated February 6, 2018, and a teleconference on February 8, 2018:
    - Update Section 3.2.P.3.3 to ensure identity testing samples are taken after labeling operations are completed to comply with 21 CFR 610.14.

4. The sterilization validation data supporting use at the manufacturing site were deficient:
    - Provide validation for the minimum sterilization cycle in the BLA resubmission.

5. Sterile filtration is not listed as a critical process parameter:
    - Include it as a critical parameter with acceptance criteria in Section 3.2.P.3.4.
