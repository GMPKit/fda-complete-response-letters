Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated May 24, 2012, received May 29, 2012, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Elepsia XR (levetiracetam) extended-release tablets, 1000 mg and 1500 mg.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated September 23, 2016, which constituted a complete response to our September 23, 2015, action letter. Specifically, this amendment included:

1. Information to address Agency comments regarding facility deficiencies  
2. Revised draft labeling, with proposed changes to dosing information for patients with renal impairment and additional labeling modifications to align with Keppra XR (innovator) labeling approved April 6, 2016

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

### FACILITY INSPECTIONS

The deficiencies associated with your manufacturing facilities remain unresolved. Specifically, during recent inspections of the Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Limited (Sun Pharma) (FEI #3002809586), facilities for this application, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facilities. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved.

### REGULATORY INFORMATION

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110.

### Letter Dated March 29, 2013  

We acknowledge receipt of amendments submitted on various dates and your amendment dated March 19, 2013, which was not reviewed for this action.

---

### CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Your product is bioequivalent to Keppra XR in the fasted state. However, in the fed state, data from Studies 131 and 272 show differences in plasma concentration-time curves.

- Simulations provided do not demonstrate shape similarity at steady state
- Cannot approve 1000 mg tablet due to lack of BE evidence for 1500 mg
- 1500 mg tablet showed dose dumping potential at highest alcohol concentration

The Division is concerned that alcohol use limitation may lead to clinical consequences unless resolved through an in vivo study.

### LABELING

We reserve comment on proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

Include updated labeling in SPL format:
