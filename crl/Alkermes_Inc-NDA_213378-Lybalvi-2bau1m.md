Dear Dr. DiPetrillo:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated November 15, 2019, received November 15, 2019, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Lybalvi (olanzapine and samidorphan).

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

### Facility Inspections

1. During a review of records requested under section 704(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and provided by Alkermes, Inc./FEI: 1000142940, Wilmington, OH, USA manufacturing facility, the FDA noted objectionable conditions. These objectionable conditions will be conveyed to the representative of the facility within 10 business days of this Complete Response Letter.

   Satisfactory resolution of these objectionable conditions is required (e.g., preapproval inspection and adequate facility responses addressing these conditions) before this application may be approved.

   If it is determined that an inspection is needed to approve your application, please note that FDA continues to monitor the public health situation as well as travel restrictions. We are actively working to define an approach for scheduling outstanding inspections, once safe travel may resume and based on public health need and other factors.

   For more information, please see the FDA guidances related to COVID-19. These guidances can be found at:  
   [https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-related-guidance-documents-industry-fda-staff-and-other-stakeholders](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-related-guidance-documents-industry-fda-staff-and-other-stakeholders)

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

3. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on:

   * [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)
   * [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)

   including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI)—a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

   If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

   * [Structured Product Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

## ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA REQUESTS

4. Present a re-tabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

5. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

6. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

7. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

8. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.

9. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## OTHER

Within 1 year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial response to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your meeting request as described in the draft guidance for industry *Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products*.
