## NDA 213586  
**COMPLETE RESPONSE**  
Teva Neuroscience, Inc.  
Attention: Levana Volovsky  
Director, Regulatory Affairs  
145 Brandywine Parkway  
West Chester, PA 19380  

Dear Ms. Volovsky:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received June 17, 2021, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for risperidone extended-release injectable suspension.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

Our review identified investigational product (IP) dosing errors including several instances of:

- Patients receiving IP doses higher than the assigned dose  
- Lack of documentation of IP administration  
- Dually and triply enrolled patients  

Because of these data quality issues, the dosing data from Study TV-46000-CNS-30072 and Study TV-46000-CNS-30078 cannot be relied upon. Given the differences in the PK profile between the listed drug and TV-46000, and the potential for trough levels to lead to relapse in patients, it is important to understand what IP doses patients actually received.

The application does not contain adequate evidence for the Agency to make an efficacy finding for this new formulation, because the doses of IP that provided benefit to patients could not be verified and thus cannot be described in the product label. In addition, the exposure-response relationship of the safety findings could not be evaluated.

### To resolve these deficiencies, submit:

- Results of an independent third party audit or post-study monitoring by the sponsor/Clinical Research Organization (CRO) for all sites and all subjects to establish the extent of IP dosing errors and lack of IP dose documentation  
- Relevant updated analyses and dosing datasets based on the audit findings  

Alternatively, submit a new adequate and well-controlled clinical efficacy and safety study.

## IDENTIFIED ISSUE TABLES

### Syringe Labels

| Identified Issue | Rationale for Concern | Recommendation |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| The “Rx Only” statement is not on the labels | The “Rx Only” statement is required on the label. | Add the “Rx Only” statement. |
| The expiration date format is not specified. | A clear expiration date format will minimize confusion and risk for deteriorated drug medication errors. | Specify the expiration date format. FDA recommends: YYYY-MM-DD (numerical) or YYYY-MMM-DD (alphabetical). If space is limited: YYYY-MM (numerical) or YYYY-MMM (alphabetical). Use a slash or hyphen to separate portions of the date. |
| The route of administration is not on the labels. | The route of administration should be on the labels. | Add the route of administration to the labels. |

---

### Carton Labeling

| Identified Issue | Rationale for Concern | Recommendation |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| There is no statement of dosage on the carton labeling. | The statement of dosage should be on the carton labeling. | Add a statement of dosage (e.g., “Recommended Dosage: See Prescribing Information”) or similar verbiage. |
| It is not clear whether there is a human-readable and machine-readable (2D data matrix barcode) product identifier on the carton labeling. | These identifiers are used for identification and tracing purposes. | Clarify whether a 2D barcode is present. If not, review FDA guidance: *Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Questions and Answers (June 2021)*: [FDA Guidance PDF](https://www.fda.gov/media/116304/download) |
| The expiration date format is not specified. | A clear expiration date format minimizes confusion and risk of errors. | Specify the expiration date format per the same recommendations as for syringe labels. |
| Strength is missing from side panel. | The strength is product-identifying information and should be present. | Add the strength (e.g., 50 mg/0.14 mL) to the side panel. |
| Product is for administration by a healthcare professional. | The statement is missing. | Add "For administration by a healthcare professional" or similar verbiage to the principal display panel. |

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

### Include the following:

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.  
2. For discontinuations, serious and common adverse events:  
   - Present new safety data in the same format as the original submission  
   - Present tabulations combining new and original data  
   - Include tables comparing frequencies of adverse events  
   - Provide separate tables for other indications  
3. Provide a retabulation of reasons for premature trial discontinuation including new trials, describing new trends or patterns.  
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each subject who died or dropped out of a trial due to an adverse event.  
   - Also provide narratives for serious adverse events.  
5. Describe substantial changes in incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between original and new data.  
6. Provide updated clinical exposure information (e.g., subjects, person-time).  
7. Provide a summary of worldwide safety experience including updated usage estimates in other countries.  
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.
