## OTHER ACTION LETTERS

### BLA 761084 - COMPLETE RESPONSE

**Kashiv BioSciences, LLC**  
Attention: John Pakulski  
Senior VP, Global Regulatory Affairs  
20 New England Avenue  
Piscataway, NJ 08854  

Dear Mr. Pakulski:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated and received August 11, 2020, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for TPI-120.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## MICROBIOLOGY

1. Information regarding media fill studies is inadequate. Please update Section 3.2.P.3.5 of the BLA with the following:  
    a. Summarized results (media fill date, container closure, filled volume, duration, number of units filled/incubated/rejected, positive) from the three initial media fill validation runs and the latest requalification run that was performed to validate the syringe line filling process relevant to the drug product.  
    b. Description of the hold periods (date, temperature, duration) simulated in each media fill run.  
    c. Description of confirmatory growth promotion test. Include a list of microorganisms used in the test.

2. The bacterial retention study for the sterilizing-grade filter was performed using the drug substance, which is not adequate. Please update BLA section 3.2.P.3.5 with the following:  
    a. Protocol and data from the validation studies using three different lots of the sterilizing filter intended for commercial production using the final drug product solution.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

10. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources) and [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule) websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI).

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 601.14(b)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at [FDA SPL site](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

11. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

12. Please refer to correspondence dated December 28, 2020, which addresses the proposed proprietary name. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

13. Following an evaluation of an inspection performed at Kashiv BioSciences (FEI 3011289655) manufacturing facility at Chicago, IL, our field investigator observed objectionable conditions at the facility. Satisfactory resolution of the remaining objectionable conditions, and verification by FDA, is required before this application may be approved.

We recommend you contact your manufacturing facility if more information is needed.

Please see the FDAâ€™s [Resiliency Roadmap for FDA Inspectional Oversight](https://www.fda.gov/media/148197/download) and [COVID-19 Related Guidance Documents](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-relatedguidance-documents-industry-fda-staff-and-other-stakeholders).

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile and their relevance, if any, to whether there may be clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar product and the U.S.-licensed reference product.
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
    - Present new safety data from the clinical studies for the proposed indication using the same format as the original BLA submission.
    - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original BLA data.
    - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original BLA with the retabulated frequencies described above.
3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature study discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed studies. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical study or who did not complete a study because of an adverse event. Also, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original BLA data.
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies (e.g., number of subjects, person time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this product, including:
    - Adverse events known to be associated with the use of the product
    - Immunogenicity
    - Updated estimate of use for this product marketed in other countries
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

### Manufacture and Control

*Content Withheld*

---

## Stability

19. Stability data was not provided for volume of injection testing to support the proposed shelf-life of 24 months for the drug product. Submit stability data under long-term storage conditions for volume of injection to support the proposed 24-month shelf life.

20. In-use stability studies were performed to support the proposed in-use conditions. A single freeze-thaw cycle was evaluated. Clarify the product quality data generated from the pre-thaw used to inform impact. Provide additional data to support multiple freeze-thaw cycles or limit them on the label accordingly.

---

## Shipping Validation

21. Real-time shipping validation studies are proposed for both drug substance and product. Current acceptance criteria rely only on release testing specifications. This is insufficient.

Update the protocols to:
- Include all product quality attributes assessed pre- and post-shipment
- Specify sufficiently narrow acceptance criteria indicating allowed changes in product quality

---

## Immunogenicity

24. You have committed to provide updated immunogenicity data based on re-calculated assay cut-points (Seq. 0018, May 15, 2021 and Seq. 0033, July 2, 2021). Provide data from this assessment upon resubmission.

---

## Microbiology

30. Update BLA Section P.5.6 with the justification of the endotoxin specification.

31. The stability protocol includes container closure integrity testing (CCIT) only at the 12-month time-point. Revise to include CCIT every 12 months until expiry.

---

## OTHER

Within one year of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other action under 21 CFR 601.3(b). Failure to respond may be considered a request to withdraw under 21 CFR 601.3(c).

A resubmission must:
- Fully address all deficiencies listed
- Be clearly marked "RESUBMISSION"
- Clearly state that this constitutes a complete response

Partial responses will not be processed as a resubmission.

You may request a meeting or teleconference. Submit your meeting request per the draft guidance: *Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants*.

Note: The drug product may not be legally marketed until FDA approval in writing.
