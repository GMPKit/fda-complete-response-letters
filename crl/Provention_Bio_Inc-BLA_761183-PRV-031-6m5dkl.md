Dear Dr. Rowland,

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated October 31, 2020, received November 2, 2020, submitted under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for PRV-031.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated April 15, April 28, May 18, May 27, June 7, and June 25 (eCTD #56), 2021, which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendments by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

1. The results of the pharmacokinetic (PK) bridging study PRV-031-004 in healthy volunteers failed to show PK comparability between the PRV-031 product used in TN-10 and the planned commercial product. Study PRV-031-004 revealed considerable differences in the total area under the time-concentration curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC₀-inf) between the two products, with the planned commercial product providing an approximately % lower AUC₀-inf, despite a comparable Cmax after a single intravenous infusion. As PK remains the primary endpoint for demonstration of comparability between the two products, you will need to establish PK comparability appropriately between the intended commercial product and the clinical trial:

   - A Phase 1, Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel Group, Single-Dose Study in Healthy Subjects to Evaluate the Bio comparability of Teplizumab (PRV-031) Manufactured at Two Sites
   - Anti-CD3 mAb (Teplizumab) for Prevention of Diabetes in Relatives At-Risk for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus

2. If changes are made to the CEX-HPLC assay as a result of the investigation, provide data and information to support that these changes to the CEX-HPLC assay do not impact the data to support this application. This should include, but not be limited to:
   - Batch release data
   - Stability data
   - In-process testing
   - Process characterization studies
   - Comparability assessment between the clinical material manufactured at Eli Lilly and the proposed commercial material manufactured at AGC Biologics

3. No information was provided in Section 3.2.S.2.3 regarding your plans to monitor Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB) stability. To correct this deficiency, provide cell bank requalification protocols for the MCB and WCB to include:
   - Frequency of testing
   - Justification for this frequency
   - Number of vials proposed to be tested at each testing timepoint
   - Tests proposed/parameters to be evaluated
   - Appropriately justified acceptance criteria

4. The protocol provided in your submission dated March 31, 2021, for requalification of the primary reference standard (PRS) is deficient. The requalification protocol should ensure that the PRS remains stable over time and suitable for its intended purpose. In order to accomplish this, address the necessary actions.

5. Insufficient information was provided regarding the levels and types of leachates in PRV-031 derived from its container closure and the risk to patients. To address this deficiency:
   - Provide sufficient data from a leachable study to evaluate the filled drug product container closure systems when stored inverted
   - Perform testing at regular intervals through the end of shelf-life
   - Include appropriate methods to detect, identify, and quantify:
     - Organic non-volatile (e.g., HPLC-UV-MS)
     - Volatile (e.g., headspace GC-MS)
     - Semi-volatile (e.g., GC-MS) species
     - Metals (e.g., ICP-MS)

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

6. During a recent inspection of the manufacturing facility for this application, our field investigators conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the following websites:

- [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 601.14(b)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at [FDA Structured Product Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Please refer to correspondence dated January 22, 2021, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Tzield. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update. The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.  
2. Incorporate new safety data into adverse event summaries:
   - Present in the same format as original submission
   - Tabulate and compare with original data
   - Separate AE tables for non-proposed indications  
3. Retabulate reasons for premature study discontinuation  
4. Submit case report forms and narratives for:
   - Patient deaths
   - Discontinuations due to AEs
   - Serious AEs  
5. Describe trends in common AEs  
6. Provide updated exposure information  
7. Summarize global safety experience  
8. Include English translations of any new foreign labelling
