PharmaEssentia Corporation  
Attention: Craig Zimmerman, PhD  
Vice President Medical and Drug Development  
35 Corporate Drive, Suite 325  
Burlington, MA 01803  

Dear Dr. Zimmerman:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated and received March 13, 2020, under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for P1101.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## HUMAN FACTORS

Based on the results of the human factors (HF) validation study data, root cause analysis, and participants’ subjective feedback, the proposed product design and user interface do not support safe and effective use of the product, as previously communicated to you in our October 15, 2020, correspondence regarding our review of your HF study results report.

We recommend that you:

- Implement our HF protocol recommendations stated in the HF validation study protocol advice letter dated February 26, 2021, prior to commencing your HF validation study
- Consider additional design modifications and labeling changes
- Submit the results of another HF validation study to demonstrate that the product can be used safely and effectively

## PROPRIETARY NAME

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

Inspections of:

- PharmaEssentia Corporation, FEI 2000012832, Taichung, Taiwan  
- PharmaEssentia Corporation, FEI 3005182038, Taipei, Taiwan  

are required before this application can be approved.

FDA must assess the ability of these facilities to conduct the listed manufacturing operations in compliance with CGMP. Due to travel restrictions, we were unable to conduct inspections during the current review cycle.

You may respond to deficiencies in this Complete Response Letter while the travel restrictions remain in effect. However, even if these deficiencies are addressed, the application cannot be approved until the required FDA inspections are conducted and any findings are assessed with regard to your application.

We will continue to monitor the public health situation and travel restrictions. For more information, please see the [FDA guidances related to COVID-19](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-related-guidance-documents-industry-fda-staff-and-other-stakeholders).

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.
3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this product. Include an updated estimate of use for product marketed in other countries.
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:

1. Two batches of drug product were used to determine the suitability of the in-process bioburden test method. However, three batches should be used for testing method suitability in the bacteriostasis/fungistasis assay. Therefore, provide in-process bioburden test method suitability results from one additional batch of P1101, 500 mcg/mL.
2. One batch of drug product was used to determine the suitability of the sterility test method conducted by PharmaEssentia Corporation. However, three batches should be used for testing method suitability in the bacteriostasis/fungistasis assay. Therefore, provide sterility test method suitability results from two additional batches of P1101, 500 mcg/mL tested at PharmaEssentia Corporation.
