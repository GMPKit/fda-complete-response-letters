- [PLR Requirements](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)  
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)

Use the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) checklist when revising labeling to ensure conformance with regulations and guidances.  

A response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in Structured Product Labeling (SPL) format as described at [Structured Product Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

## Carton and Container Labeling

Submit revised draft labeling:

### A. Container and Carton Labeling

1. Placeholder “barcode space” must be replaced with an actual graphical representation of a linear barcode surrounded by sufficient white space as required by 21 CFR 201.25(c)(i).  
2. Clearly define the expiration date format. Recommended formats:
   - Numeric: `YYYY-MM-DD`  
   - Alpha month: `YYYY-MMM-DD`  
   - If space limited: `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY-MMM`  
   - Use hyphens or spaces to separate portions of the date.

## Safety Update

Include a safety update as described in 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). Include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies, regardless of indication/dosage.

1. Describe significant changes or findings in the safety profile.  
2. Incorporate new safety data regarding:
   - Discontinuations due to adverse events  
   - Serious adverse events  
   - Common adverse events  
   Include:
   - New safety data from relevant studies in original format  
   - Combined data tabulations with original application  
   - Frequency comparison tables for adverse events  
   - Separate data tables for other indications  
3. Retabulate reasons for premature trial discontinuation with new data.  
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for:
   - All patients who died or discontinued due to adverse events  
   - Serious adverse events  
5. Describe changes in incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events.  
6. Provide updated clinical trial exposure data.  
7. Provide worldwide safety experience summary, including use estimate.  
8. Submit English translations of any newly approved foreign labeling.

## Other Actions Required

You must resubmit or take action within one year [21 CFR 314.110] or the application may be withdrawn [21 CFR 314.65]. You may request an extension of time.

Resubmissions must:

- Address all deficiencies  
- Be clearly marked as **RESUBMISSION** in bold, large font  
- Include a cover letter stating that the application is a complete response  
- Partial responses will not initiate a new review cycle

You may request a teleconference with FDA to discuss next steps.
