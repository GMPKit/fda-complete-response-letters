Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated March 26, 2020, received March 26, 2020, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Technegas™ Technetium Tc-99m carbon aerosol.

We acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated February 26, 2021, which extended the goal date by three months to June 26, 2021.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

### A. Drug Substance and Drug Product

#### 1. Characterization and Control of the Aerosol Drug

The NDA has not provided adequate characterization of the aerosol, including:

- Aerosol composition
- Batch formula
- Batch data
- Stability data
- Identity, strength, purity
- Delivered dose
- Generator yield and duty cycle
- Generator recertification period
- Critical quality attributes and specifications

You must:

- Develop a quality program to characterize and control your Technegas aerosol drug product
- Validate aerosol production at full radioactivity range
- Propose and describe validated analytical methods
- Establish specifications with justified acceptance criteria
- Submit results from at least three production runs at both radioactivity extremes

#### 2. Validation of the Aerosol Drug Production and Documentation

Provide:

- Aerosol batch data from validated methods for at least three registration batches (min and max radioactivity)
- Commercial process and in-process controls
- Sodium pertechnetate injection solution sourced from approved U.S. manufacturers: Technelite, Ultra-TechneKow, and Radiogenix
- Revised production description per December 7, 2020 Discipline Review Letter:
  - Include volume and strength of sodium pertechnetate solution
  - Include percent yield (min and max range)
  - Remove unnecessary statements

#### 3. Analytical Methods to Characterize:

- Aerosol particle size distribution
- Radioactivity
- Aerosol yield

Due to unique properties (radioactivity, short expiry), standard aerosol methods may not apply. You may consider literature such as:

> Jérémie Pourchez et al., *Generation and characterization of radiolabeled nanosized carbonaceous aerosols for human inhalation studies*, J. Aerosol Sci., 2013, 55, pp.1–11.

Submit:

- Each method’s description
- Method validation

#### 4. Control of Crucible (Critical Component)

The NDA has not provided:

- Crucible specifications (release or stability)
- Batch/stability data
- Post-approval stability protocol

You must:

- Develop a control program for crucibles
- Revise specifications and submit data
- Submit stability protocol

---

### B. PROCESS

#### 5. Environmental Controls

Your environmental controls are inadequate. You must:

- Implement minimum environmental controls
- Monitor the environment before packaging
- Comply with 21 CFR 211.46

#### 6. Manufacturing Control Strategy for Crucible

Issues include:

- Lack of validated parameters at all stages
- Insufficient in-process control support for critical attributes
- Gaps in raw data generation/storage/documentation

Please address and correct these deficiencies.

#### 7. Shipping

ISTA study protocol and test reports submitted on 1/7/2021 fail to:

- Address adverse observations
- Propose corrective actions or design changes

You must:

- Provide updated test reports
- Address observations
- Submit corrective actions and packaging designs
- Conduct new shipping study if packaging changes

#### 8. Production

You have:

- Not demonstrated consistent Tcm-99 carbon aerosol production
- Failed to meet yield requirements under 21 CFR 211.103
- Not complied with 21 CFR Part 4 / 820 if using streamlined Pathway

#### 9. Reliability Assessment

The submitted reliability report (val-003):

- Is not based on verified protocols or test methods
- Relies only on customer complaints

You must:

- Submit verification protocol
- Include analytical methods, specifications, acceptance criteria
- Provide the final report

#### 10. Yield

While frm-0077 (Technegas™ maintenance/repair checklist) and mnl-004 US TP preventive maintenance instruction submitted on 2/26/2021 are acknowledged, they do not address ongoing yield monitoring as required by approved drug specifications.

---

### C. DEVICE

#### 11. Exposure Dose

Submit:

- Calculations for exposure doses and margin of safety thresholds
- Tabulated values (where applicable)
- Explanatory notes on inputs:
  - Analytical concentrations
  - Exposure assumptions (e.g., maximum breathing volumes)
  - Conversion and toxicity metrics
  - Uncertainty factors

---

### D. CLINICAL

#### 12. Risk of Dyspnea and Hypoxia

Raw data from Study CYC-009:

- 21% inhaled Technegas without operator intervention
- Insufficient operator instructions on oxygen/room air or administration time

Submit:

a. For each breathing method:

   i. Specify/estimate proportion of CYC-009 subjects  
   ii. Link to other studies (e.g., `lloyd-1994-2.pdf`, `james-1991c.pdf`)  
   iii. Discuss pros/cons regarding biodistribution and risk mitigation

b. Augment current operator/prescriber instructions to reflect Issue #3a analysis

#### 13. Recommended Loading Range in Adults

Justify your proposed/revised sodium pertechnetate Tc-99m injection range by:

- Referencing actual doses used in CYC-009
- Discussing gaps and tradeoffs between studied/recommended usage

Include range in new CMC study (see Product Quality Issue #1)

#### 14. Pediatric Patients (Age 6+)

Justify:

- Recommended lung count rate: 500–1000 cps
- Loading range used and their justification

Also provide:

- Use estimates from literature
- Market experience or survey-based estimates focused on pediatric patients

Include range in new CMC study (see Product Quality Issue #1)
