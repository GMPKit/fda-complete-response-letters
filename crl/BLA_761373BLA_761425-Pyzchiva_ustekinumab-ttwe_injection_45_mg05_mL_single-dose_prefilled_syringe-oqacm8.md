## Indications

Moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD), and adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.

## Application Structure

For administrative purposes, we have split BLAs 761373 and 761425 as follows:

- BLA 761373/Original 1 – biosimilarity  
- BLA 761373/Original 2 – interchangeability  
- BLA 761425/Original 1 – biosimilarity  
- BLA 761425/Original 2 – interchangeability  

The subjects of this correspondence are:

- BLA 761373/Original 2  
- BLA 761425/Original 2  

A separate correspondence was issued for BLA 761373/Original 1 and BLA 761425/Original 1.

All future submissions should specify the BLA and Original number to which each submission pertains.

## Provisional Review

We have completed a provisional review of this application, as amended. A final determination under sections 351(i) and 351(k) of the PHS Act that:

- Pyzchiva (ustekinumab-ttwe) injection 45 mg/0.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringe for subcutaneous use would be interchangeable with Stelara (ustekinumab) injection 45 mg/0.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringe for subcutaneous use  
- Pyzchiva (ustekinumab-ttwe) injection 90 mg/mL single-dose prefilled syringe for subcutaneous use would be interchangeable with Stelara (ustekinumab) injection 90 mg/mL single-dose prefilled syringe for subcutaneous use  
- Pyzchiva (ustekinumab-ttwe) injection 130 mg/26 mL (5 mg/mL) single-dose vial for intravenous use would be interchangeable with Stelara (ustekinumab) injection 130 mg/26 mL (5 mg/mL) single-dose vial for intravenous use  

is currently subject to an unexpired period of exclusivity for the first interchangeable biosimilar biological products and thus may not be made before the exclusivity period has expired. See section 351(k)(6) of the PHS Act.

We have not identified any deficiencies that would justify a complete response action at this time; however, we also cannot approve your application because of the unexpired period of exclusivity. We have therefore provisionally determined that your 351(k) application meets the interchangeability criteria under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.

This provisional determination is based upon information currently available to the Agency (i.e., information in your application and that the manufacturing of the biological product complies with regulatory standards). This determination is subject to change if any new information becomes available.

## Request for Approval

To obtain approval of this application, submit an amendment no more than six months prior to the date you believe the application will be eligible for approval.

In your cover letter, clearly identify the amendment as:

> "REQUEST FOR APPROVAL"

This amendment should include the following:

- Legal/regulatory basis for the request  
- Copy of relevant supporting documentation  
- Safety update  
- Identify changes (if any) including:  
  - Updated labeling  
  - Chemistry, manufacturing, and controls data  
  - Risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS)  

If there are no changes, clearly state this in your cover letter. All changes require review before approval, and the goal date for review will be set accordingly.

BLA 761373/Original 2 and BLA 761425/Original 2 are not approved and Pyzchiva (ustekinumab-ttwe) cannot be legally marketed as an interchangeable biosimilar product unless and until you have been notified in writing of approval.

The currently agreed upon labeling is enclosed:

- Prescribing Information  
- Medication Guide  
- Instructions for Use  
- Carton and Container Labeling

If you believe that there are grounds for issuing the approval letter before the expiration of the exclusivity period, amend your application accordingly.

## Required Pediatric Assessments

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) (21 U.S.C. 355c), all applications for:

- New active ingredients (includes new salts and new fixed combinations)  
- New indications  
- New dosage forms  
- New dosing regimens  
- New routes of administration  

must include an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication in pediatric patients unless this requirement is waived, deferred, or inapplicable.

Refer to the BLA Approval letter for BLA 761373/Original 1 and BLA 761425/Original 1 for required pediatric assessments.

## Postmarketing Commitments Not Subject to the Reporting Requirements Under Section 506B

We remind you of your BLA 761425 postmarketing commitment:

**4651-1**  
Develop an endotoxin testing method for the 5 mg/mL drug product that mitigates the low endotoxin recovery (LER) effect. Submit method qualification results with 3 lots of 5 mg/mL drug product, and provide results of a LER study performed with the updated method using 3 lots of drug product.

> The USP <151> pyrogen test will be replaced by a suitable in vitro endotoxin method upon approval of the supplement.

**Timetable**  
Submitted: January 9, 2024  
Final Report Submission: January 2026  

Submit:

- Clinical protocols to your IND 136959  
- Nonclinical and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls protocols and all postmarketing final reports to the respective BLA  

Annual progress reports under 21 CFR 601.70 should include:

- Status summary of each commitment  
- Expected summary completion and final report submission dates  
- Changes in plans since the last annual report  
- For clinical studies/trials, number of patients/subjects entered into each study/trial  

All submissions must be prominently labeled:
