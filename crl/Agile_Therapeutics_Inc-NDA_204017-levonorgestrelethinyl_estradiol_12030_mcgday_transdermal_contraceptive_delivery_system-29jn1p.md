## COMPLETE RESPONSE

**To:** Agile Therapeutics, Inc.  
**Attention:** Mark B. Carroll  
Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance  
101 Poor Farm Road, 3rd Floor  
Princeton, NJ 08540  

Dear Mr. Carroll:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated April 12, 2012, received April 13, 2012, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol 120/30 mcg/day transdermal contraceptive delivery system.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated June 26, 2017, which constituted a complete response to our February 13, 2013, action letter.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated December 1, 2017, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. The reasons for our decision are detailed below.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

### Drug Product

Adhesion of your transdermal system to skin is critical for safe and effective use. We previously raised concerns in the February 13, 2013 Complete Response Letter. Significant adhesion problems remain based on quality issues and findings from the most recent clinical study, ATI-CL23.

**Findings:**

- In-process adhesion data for clinical and commercial-scale intermediates were not comparable.
- High frequency of invalid results.
- The proposed finished product specification lacks a validated test and appropriate acceptance criteria for Part Tack.
- TP074 adhesion test is variable, subjective, and not interpretable.

### Identified Drug Product Quality Deficiencies

1. In-process adhesion and tack tests are not suitable for ensuring commercial-scale product quality and in vivo adhesion.
2. Finished drug product specification does not assure quality, tack, and adhesion at release or on stability.
3. During inspection of Corium International Inc. (FEI 3003693015), objectionable conditions were observed.

---

## CLINICAL

In Study ATI-CL23:

- 11.3% of patches had less than 75% adherence during the 7-day wear cycle.
- Over 50% of subjects reported at least one complete patch detachment.
- Higher-than-expected Pearl Index (5.83; 95% CI 4.45–7.21).
- Over 50% subject discontinuation rate.
- Over 40% unscheduled bleeding rate (cycle control).
- Serious risks such as thromboembolic events are comparable with other hormonal contraceptives.

**Summary:**

You have not demonstrated adequate in vivo adhesion to ensure safety and efficacy. It is unclear how much this adhesion issue affects efficacy, unscheduled bleeding, and drop-outs.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS THE DEFICIENCIES

### Drug Product

1. Determine if poor adhesion is due to the product design/formulation or other factors.
2. Develop and validate in-process tests for tack and adhesion with justified ranges.
3. Develop and validate finished product release/stability tests for tack and adhesion with justified ranges.

### Facility Inspections

4. Resolve objectionable conditions at the manufacturing site (FEI 3003693015).

### Clinical

5. Reassess in vivo adhesion issues and how they may affect efficacy and safety. Consider designing a new transdermal system and conduct a new clinical trial in the U.S.
