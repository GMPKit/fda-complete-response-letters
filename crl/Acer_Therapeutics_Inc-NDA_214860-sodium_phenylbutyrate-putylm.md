## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiency, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. For adverse event data:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables comparing frequencies of adverse events between the original and new data.
   - For other indications, provide separate tables on adverse events.
3. Provide a retabulation of reasons for premature trial discontinuation with drop-outs from new trials. Describe any new trends or patterns.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for:
   - Each subject who died during a clinical trial
   - Subjects who did not complete a trial due to an adverse event
   - Serious adverse events
5. Describe any information suggesting a substantial change in the incidence of common, less serious adverse events.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comment that is not an approvability issue:

### Nonclinical

In the chronic dog study of talc:

- Absolute testis weights were statistically significantly increased (43–55%) in all treated groups.  
- This abnormality persisted when normalized to body or brain weight.
- No NOAEL was established.
- The pathology report lacks correlating microscopic findings.
- No additional data were submitted to interpret this finding.

To facilitate further assessment, provide:

a. Exact ages of all dogs in the completed study and in the historical control database, and correlate with testis weights.

b. A review of all published studies in animals/humans assessing talc safety. Include:
   - Species used  
   - Doses administered  
   - Study durations  
   - Relevant human data  

Summarize the relevance to the dose of talc in 20 g of your proposed product.

If this information does not clarify the cause or mechanism:

- A new 9-month study of talc in male dogs may be required using lower doses  
- Assess serum gonadotropins, testosterone, and accessory sex organ weights  
- The study report should include exact dog ages at necropsy and control dog ages
