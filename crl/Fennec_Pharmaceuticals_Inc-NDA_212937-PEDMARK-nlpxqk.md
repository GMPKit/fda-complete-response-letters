## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

a. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

b. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:

- Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
- Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
- Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
- For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

c. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

d. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

e. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

f. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

g. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.

h. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

# COMPLETE RESPONSE

**NDA 212937**  
**Fennec Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**  
Attention: Anne McKay  
Regulatory Affairs Agent  
P.O. Box 13628  
68 T.W. Alexander Drive  
Research Triangle Park, NC 27709

Dear Ms. McKay:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated February 10, 2020, received February 10, 2020, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), for **PEDMARK** (sodium thiosulfate injection), for intravenous use, 12.5 grams/100 mL.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

1. Test PEDMARK registration batches in accordance with the USP monograph for Sodium Thiosulfate Injection. You may use an alternative test method for assay; however, the USP method will be considered the regulatory method. Refer to USP General Notices and Requirements: 6.30 Alternative and Harmonized Methods and Procedures for more details.

2. Submit a new assay test method, intended for commercial use, that expresses assay in terms of the pentahydrate. Alternatively, you may revise the calculations for the currently proposed non-compendial ion chromatography assay method so that the drug product assay is calculated based on the sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate form.

3. If you plan to use the currently proposed non-compendial assay test method, provide comparative data to show that the method is comparable to the compendial test method. Per the USP monograph, the assay must be calculated based on sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

- Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
- Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
- For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original/supplemental application data.

6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug/product marketed in other countries.

8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.
