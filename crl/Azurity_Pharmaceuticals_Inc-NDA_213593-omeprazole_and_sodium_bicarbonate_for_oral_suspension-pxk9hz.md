Dear Mr. Beckloff,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated March 30, 2020, received March 30, 2020, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate for oral suspension.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated December 15, 2020 and January 8, 2021, which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

Based on our review of the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information provided in the original submission and reviewed amendments, we find that the proposed control strategy is insufficient to assure the identity, strength, purity, quality, and bioavailability of the drug product as required by 21 CFR 314.50.

Specifically, the submission lacks sufficient information to demonstrate that the proposed control strategy for the omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate active ingredients of this combination product meets the regulatory standard. The following deficiencies are noted:

1. **Sodium Bicarbonate**

   a. The suitability of the proposed assay method for the active ingredient sodium bicarbonate has not been fully demonstrated. Thus, the method may be underestimating the amount of sodium bicarbonate at the high end and, more importantly, may be overestimating the amount of sodium bicarbonate at the low end.

   b. There are no data demonstrating that the diluent and constituted suspension will consistently meet the requisite sodium bicarbonate assay acceptance criterion of 90.0% to 110.0% of the label claim (LC) at release and throughout the shelf-life. Similarly, there are no data to demonstrate that the constituted suspension will meet the 90.0% to 110.0% of the LC and throughout the 30-day in-use period.

2. **Omeprazole**

   The strength and uniformity of the active ingredient omeprazole in the constituted suspension at release and on stability are not assured. Analytical procedure MET-CDM-000025 for omeprazole identification, assay, and within bottle uniformity (submitted October 16, 2020, SN 0027) differs from the assay procedure submitted in SN 0001 used for analyzing the constituted suspension in the registration stability studies. Furthermore, the Analytical Method Validation Report (04-R-MV-18-026.01) submitted in SN 0001 does not cover Method used in MET-CDM-000025. Additionally, the comparability of MET-CDM-000025 to the previously used method has not been demonstrated.

3. You have not established an in-process control for the product.

---

### To Address These Deficiencies

1. Revise specifications for the diluent and the constituted oral suspension to include relevant tests, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria for identification and assay of sodium bicarbonate. Update sections 3.2.P.5.1 accordingly.

2. Provide evidence or revise methodology to verify accuracy and reliability of the sodium bicarbonate assay procedure.

3. Submit method validation reports for MET-CDM-000025 and demonstrate data comparability with the prior method.

4. Submit batch release data and at least 6 months stability data from batches in all proposed filling configurations (90 mL, 150 mL, and 300 mL). Include in-use stability details for suspensions prepared from these batches.

5. Ensure diluent batches used match revised manufacturing processes and submit representative batch record with updates to 3.2.P.3.3 as needed.

6. Address in-process control deficiencies with a defined sampling plan and acceptance criteria aligned to final product release testing. Update section 3.3.P.3.4 accordingly.

## CLINICAL

The application does not provide adequate information to support the proposed indication:

> “reduction of risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients”

Specifically, data supporting safety and effectiveness of administration via nasogastric and orogastric tube is required.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Labeling will be reviewed when application deficiencies are resolved. Please consult PLR and SRPI guidance. If revised, labeling should include:

- Conformance with regulatory guidance
- Updated SPL format
- Response to initial December 22, 2020 comments

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

Submit updated draft labeling based on FDA’s proposed revisions dated January 8, 2021.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

The name **Konvomep** was found acceptable on November 25, 2020, pending application approval. Reconfirm the proprietary name upon resubmission.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

Submit an updated safety report in accordance with 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b), including:

1. Summary of safety profile changes
2. Integrated safety data (original + new)
3. Discontinuation analysis and emerging patterns
4. Serious adverse event narratives
5. Changes in adverse event frequency
6. Updated subject exposure data
7. Global postmarketing safety experience
8. Translated foreign labeling (if applicable)

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

**Not approvability issues, but require clarification**:

1. **Particle Size Distribution (Proc. No. 20-12-SP-2972)**

   - Submit Method Development Report No. 19-012-80800-R01.
   - Confirm absence of particle size reduction under proposed conditions.
   - Provide particle size data for the constituted suspension.

2. **Fill Weight Clarification**

   - Confirm omeprazole and diluent target fill volumes for all marketed doses (90, 150, 300 mL).
   - Describe how these targets were determined to ensure proper concentration and volume delivery.

---

## OTHER

You must resubmit or take regulatory action within one year of this letter date, or the application may be subject to withdrawal under 21 CFR 314.65.

Only a **Complete Resubmission** will trigger a new review cycle, not partial responses.

Meeting requests should follow FDA guidance for formal meetings with sponsors and applicants.

**Marketing of the drug is not permitted until written application approval is received.**
