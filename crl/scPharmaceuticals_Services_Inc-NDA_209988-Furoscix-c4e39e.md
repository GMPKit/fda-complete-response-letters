## Introduction

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated August 23, 2017, received August 23, 2017, and your amendments submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Furoscix™ (Furosemide) 80 mg/10 mL, a drug-device combination product.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated June 30, 2020, which constituted a complete response to our June 11, 2018 action letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form.

---

## Device

1. You made significant changes to the design of your to-be-marketed device during this review cycle without FDA’s prior knowledge. Additional deficiencies may be identified once the final device design is submitted. Ensure all submitted information reflects the to-be-marketed device.

2. You reference a Master Access File (MAF) to support the device constituent. There are outstanding deficiencies communicated to the MAF holder.  
   Recommendations:  
   - Coordinate with the MAF holder to resolve deficiencies.  
   - Resubmit your NDA only once deficiencies are resolved and documentation is adequate.

---

## Biocompatibility

3. In report "device-rpt-0352", differences exist between the biocompatibility test article and the final finished product.  
   - Provide particulate testing per USP <788> Method 1 on the final finished device.

4. In "device-rpt-0351", it is unclear if particulate testing was conducted per USP <788> Method 1 (Light Obscuration) or Method 2 (Microscopic).  
   - Clarify the test method. If Method 2 was used, provide testing per Method 1.

5. Report "3.2.R 1 P 3 – Device Summary" references ISO for adhesive patch cytotoxicity. Report "device-rpt-0352" uses ISO Direct Contact.  
   - Clarify which method was used and provide justification.

---

## Chemical Characterization

6. In "Leachables Screening" document, clarify if sample preparation occurred under clinically relevant conditions.  
   - Provide justification or additional testing.

7. GC/MS direct injection results include spike recoveries.  
   - Justify method suitability for detecting semi-volatile and volatile compounds or provide new testing.

---

## Electrical Safety and Electromagnetic Compatibility

8. Labeling lacks adequate safety per IEC 60601-1:  
   - a. Revise IFU per IEC 60601-1-2:2014 clause 5.2.1.1.f.  
   - b. Include essential performance info per clause 5.2.1.1.b.  
   - c. Add battery specifications (type, voltage, power) to Labels 0063, 0068, 0069, 0072, and 0073.

---

## Labeling

9. Your labeling needs significant updates and must:  
   - Include electrical safety and EMC symbols  
   - Software version, residual/hold-up volume  
   - Warnings for use in imaging environments  
   - Consider FDA guidance (Design Considerations for Devices Intended for Home Use, Infusion Pumps Total Product Life Cycle).

10. You state the device may be applied at home or in clinic but provide insufficient evidence.  
    - Update the IFU accordingly.

---

## Human Factors

11. HF validation excluded participants with relevant skin conditions or medication use.  
    - Risk analysis does not assess issues if such patients use the device.  
    - Submit updated risk analysis and potentially a new HF validation study.

12. The device was modified after the HF validation study.  
    - Update your use-related risk analysis and evaluate whether a new HF validation study is required.  
    - Provide revised labeling comparison, task analysis, and justification if not conducting a new HF study.

---

## Software/Cybersecurity

13. Alarms/errors info not found in the Master File.  
    - Update your Safety Assurance Case to include:  
      - Reliability specifications for system-level alarms  
      - Code coverage requirements for static testing

---

## Engineering/Performance/Risk Assessment

14. Your justification for not requiring fluid ingress testing is inadequate.  
    - Provide ingress protection validation.

15. Provide trigger limits for all alarms and evidence they work at boundary conditions.

16. The error notification time is unclear.  
    - Redesign or justify the notification time for underdose events.

---

## Safety Assurance Case (SAC): Introduction

17. SAC references are incomplete. Ensure all cited evidence uses specific file names with revision numbers.

18. Testing and hazard tracing is unclear.  
    - Provide a complete Design Verification and Validation Plan that clearly links hazards to mitigations.

19. SAC lacks justification for specifications adequacy.  
    - Define and justify all design requirements.

---

## SAC: Verification and Validation of Design Requirements

20. You cite standards without adequate conformity evidence.  
    - Follow Agency guidance for voluntary consensus standards  
    - State all allowances clearly and justify use of non-recognized standards  
    - Complete your device development before seeking regulatory approval

21. Your Verification and Validation Plan (device-ddp0038) is inadequate:  
    - a. Evidence in MAF is inconsistent  
    - b. Plan lacks detail (sampling/stat methods, aging, descriptions)  
    - c. MAF evidence does not verify shelf life  
    - d. Missing referenced reports  
    - e. Reports use outdated device versions  
    - f. Requirements deemed not requiring validation must be validated  
    - g. Essential Performance Requirements not fully supported  
    - h. MAF data needs correction

22. Provide test reports matching FDA’s recommendations in "Recommended Content and Format of Non-Clinical Bench Performance Testing Information in Premarket Submissions" (Dec 2019).

---

## SAC: Adequate Risk Mitigations

23. SAC lacks clear tracing of risks and mitigations.  
    - Update SAC to reference specific risk documents.

24. Severity ratings in SOP-0034 may be inconsistent.  
    - Update definitions or mitigations accordingly.

25. Hazard analysis does not clearly show risk mitigation.  
    - Address misaligned hazard/risk terminology  
    - Update outdated hazards tied to old device versions  
    - Classify software-specific hazards by severity

---

## SAC: Demonstration of Adequate Reliability

26. Device changes during review make current reliability data irrelevant.  
    - Provide updated data for to-be-marketed device.

27. Submit a reliability protocol and define reliability requirement  
    - Provide evidence-based argument achieving that requirement.

28. Link the reliability argument to clinical risks and align with device’s actual use-case.
