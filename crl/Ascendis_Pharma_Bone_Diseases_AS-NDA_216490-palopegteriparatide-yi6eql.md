## OTHER ACTION LETTERS

### NDA 216490  
## COMPLETE RESPONSE  

Ascendis Pharma Bone Diseases A/S  
c/o Ascendis Pharma, Inc.  
Attention: Stephanie Chan, MS  
Director, Regulatory Affairs  
1000 Page Mill Road  
Palo Alto, CA 94304  

Dear Ms. Chan,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received August 31, 2022, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for palopegteriparatide injection.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated April 6, 2023, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY / DEVICE

Your application has unresolved deficiencies concerning:

- Significant variability of the delivered dose, a product critical quality attribute  
- Lack of adequate data to support the feasibility of your revised assay and delivered volume specification with respect to limiting the variability of the deliverable dose to μg at each dose setting  
- An anticipated high-level of batch failure with your proposed specifications, indicative of inadequate formulation and device design  
- Inadequate stability data to support shelf-life determination of your product per the revised specification for the delivered dose  

---

## LABELING

- The Final Rule (Physician Labeling Rule) on the content and format of the PI for human drug and biological products  
- The Final Rule (Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule) on the content and format of information in the PI on pregnancy, lactation, and females and males of reproductive potential  
- Regulations and related guidance documents  
- A sample tool illustrating the format for Highlights and Contents  
- The SRPI − a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances  
- FDA’s established pharmacologic class (EPC) text phrases for inclusion in the Highlights Indications and Usage heading  
- Additional resources for the PI, patient labeling, and carton/container labeling  

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Refer to correspondence dated November 28, 2022, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Yorvipath. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.  
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:  
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.  
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.  
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.  
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.  
3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.  
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each subject who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.  
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.  
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).  
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.  
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## POSTMARKETING REQUIREMENTS UNDER 505(o)(3)

As described in our electronic communication dated January 31, 2023, we have determined that, if this application is approved, you will be required to conduct postmarketing studies of palopegteriparatide to assess a known risk of hypocalcemia/hypercalcemia and to identify other unexpected serious risks of:

- Pregnancy and maternal complications  
- Adverse effects on the developing fetus and neonate  
- Adverse effects on the infant potentially associated with palopegteriparatide use during pregnancy and lactation

Specifically, we have determined that, if your NDA is approved, you will be required, pursuant to section 505(o)(3) of the FDCA, to conduct the following:

1. A lactation study (milk only) in lactating women who have received therapeutic doses of palopegteriparatide, using a validated assay to assess concentrations of palopegteriparatide in breast milk and the effects on the breastfed infant.  
2. A worldwide descriptive study that collects prospective and retrospective data in women exposed to palopegteriparatide during pregnancy and/or lactation to assess:  
   - The risk of pregnancy and maternal complications  
   - Adverse effects on the developing fetus and neonate  
   - Adverse effects on the infant potentially associated with palopegteriparatide use during pregnancy  

   Infant outcomes are to be assessed through at least the first year of life. The minimum number of patients will be specified in the protocol.

Any additional specific details of these required postmarketing studies, including a timetable and annual reporting requirements, will be described more fully in the approval letter for this application, if it is approved.

If you complete either of these studies prior to resubmitting your application, you may include the final report and relevant data sets in your Complete Response submission to facilitate review of the information.

---

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. You may also request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial response to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your meeting request as described in the draft guidance for industry _Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products_.  
*The most recent version of guidances can be found at: https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm*
