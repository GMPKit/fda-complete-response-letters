**NDA 210583**  
**Complete Response**  
**Sponsor:** Recro Pharma Inc.  
490 Lapp Road  
Malvern, PA 19355  
**Attention:** Diane P. Myers, SVP, Regulatory and Quality  

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received July 26, 2017, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), for Meloxicam Injection, 30 mg/mL.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated September 24, 2018, which constituted a complete response to our May 23, 2018, action letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## CLINICAL

1. Meloxicam Injection has an onset of action in the range of 2 to 3 hours (possibly longer if patients receiving early rescue had been excluded from this analysis). The delayed onset fails to adequately meet prescriber expectations for intravenous (IV) drugs. Meloxicam Injection is unfit for use as an IV drug for acute pain as monotherapy. Furthermore, the analgesic effect wanes approximately 18 hours after dosing, making it of questionable utility as a component of multimodal analgesic therapy with 24-hour dosing interval. The proposal to label the product based on pharmacokinetic modeling fails to adequately address the efficacy deficiencies and does not provide a benefit that could outweigh the additional safety risks associated with the higher meloxicam levels resulting from shorter dosing intervals.

    a. Regarding efficacy, the available efficacy and pharmacokinetic data do not support a finding of an exposure/response relationship suitable to rely on pharmacokinetic modeling to support a change in dosing interval. Measures of pain intensity are not well correlated with drug concentration data at the same time point. Specifically, high plasma meloxicam concentrations are achieved shortly after the first dose, but the median onset of pain relief is not reported until Hour 2 or 3. The pharmacokinetic data also do not explain the end-of-dose failure, as there is little change in plasma meloxicam levels between Hours 18 and 24 (from approximately 1700 ng/mL to 1500 ng/mL). Therefore, the proposed changes to dosing instructions do not adequately address the observed efficacy deficiencies.

    b. The available safety data for Meloxicam Injection are inadequate to support the safety. Many adverse events associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as meloxicam are dose- and exposure-related.

        - Meloxicam levels predicted by the pharmacokinetic modeling are higher than the measured levels with 24-hour dosing.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

2. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) − a checklist of important format items.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the prescribing information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:  
http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

3. Revised draft carton and container labeling was submitted February 25, 2019. When resubmitting the application, revise as follows:

### 1. Container Label

a. Add the lot number in accordance with 21 CFR 201.10(i)(1).  
b. Add the expiration date in accordance with 21 CFR 201.17 and 21 CFR 211.137. To minimize confusion and reduce the risk for deteriorated drug medication errors, include:

- Human-readable expiration date with year, month, and non-zero day in YYYY-MM-DD format (numerical) or YYYY-MMM-DD (alphabetical).  
- If space is limited, use YYYY-MM or YYYY-MMM.  
- Use a hyphen or space to separate date portions.

### 2. Carton Labeling – Single Vial

a. FDA released draft guidance (September 2018) on product identifiers required under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. Manufacturers and repackagers must affix product identifiers to each package and homogeneous case introduced to commerce as of November 27, 2017 and November 27, 2018, respectively. Guidance available at:  
https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-drugsgen/documents/document/ucm621044.pdf

b. See Container Label comments a and b.
