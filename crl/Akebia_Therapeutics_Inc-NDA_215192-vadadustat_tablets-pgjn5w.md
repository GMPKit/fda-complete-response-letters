### CLINICAL AND STATISTICAL

Your submitted data do not support a favorable benefit-risk assessment of vadadustat for the proposed indication of treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults not on dialysis and on dialysis. Our determination that the benefits of vadadustat do not outweigh the risks applies to both the non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) and dialysis-dependent (DD) populations of patients with anemia associated with CKD.

While you have met the efficacy endpoint of hemoglobin (Hb) response by demonstrating non-inferiority to darbepoetin alfa in both populations, the following concerns limit the interpretation of benefit:

- Higher use of rescue therapy with vadadustat, including:
  - ESA rescue in the NDD-CKD population
  - ESA and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion rescue in the DD-CKD population
    - Example:
      - DD-CKD Trial 0016: ESA rescue in 22% (vadadustat) vs. 5% (darbepoetin alfa)
      - DD-CKD Trial 0017: 35% vs. 14% respectively

- Increased RBC transfusion with vadadustat may increase alloreactivity, risking renal allograft rejection.

Oral administration may offer convenience for some populations but is less clear for most DD-CKD patients receiving hemodialysis, where ESA is administered during treatment. No other benefits were established.

---

### Safety Concerns

We have identified major safety concerns that outweigh the benefits:

#### 1. Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) in NDD-CKD
- Vadadustat did not establish non-inferiority to darbepoetin alfa on MACE:
  - HR: 1.17 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.36)
  - Exceeds non-inferiority margin of 1.25
  - Each MACE component had unfavorable HRs for vadadustat
  - In U.S. subgroup: 
    - MACE HR: 1.06 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.29)
    - Non-fatal MI HR: 1.49 (95% CI: 0.97, 2.30)

#### 2. Thromboembolic (TE) Events in DD-CKD
- Vadadustat associated with increased TE event risk:
  - Overall HR: 1.20 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.50)
  - U.S. subgroup HR: 1.46 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.89)
  - Vascular access thrombosis HR: 1.28 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.63)
  - >80% TE events were vascular access thromboses

#### 3. Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
- Evidence includes:
  - 1 Hy’s Law case
  - 7 probable DILI cases (ALT elevation without jaundice)
  - ALT >3x ULN: 0.47% (vadadustat) vs. 0.35% (darbepoetin alfa)
  - ALT >5x ULN: 0.31% vs. 0.25% respectively
  - Risk could be underestimated in real-world use due to less frequent monitoring

---

### Potential Path Forward

#### 1. Conduct New Clinical Trial(s)
Evaluate benefit/risk in specific populations or with altered dosing. Ensure assessment of:

- ESA and RBC transfusion rescue as secondary efficacy endpoints
- **Rhabdomyolysis**:
  - NDD: 10 cases (vadadustat) vs. 4 (darbepoetin alfa)
  - DD: 5 vs. 3 respectively
- **Seizures**: Adverse event of interest; incidence appears comparable to ESA risks

#### 2. Risk Mitigation Strategy for Hepatotoxicity
- Develop strategies to identify and mitigate risk of DILI
- Address challenges:
  - DILI is idiosyncratic
  - Lower real-world monitoring compared to trials
  - Risk of acute liver failure or death

---

### ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

(Not approvability issues)

- Higher risk of **gastrointestinal adverse reactions**, including acid-related disease, observed with vadadustat versus darbepoetin alfa  
- Labeling may mitigate these risks if confirmed in future trials  

---

### OTHER
