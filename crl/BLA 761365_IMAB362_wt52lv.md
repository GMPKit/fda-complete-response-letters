## APPLICATION NUMBER:  
761365Orig1s000  

## OTHER ACTION LETTERS

---

### 1. Testing Methods

- The sterility test should be performed according to the USP <71> compendial method.  
- Update the method procedure in section 3.2.P.5.2 accordingly.

### 2. Container Closure Integrity Test (CCIT)

- The CCIT method used for drug product stability testing was validated for specificity and detection limit (refer to Table 2 of section 3.2.P.8.3).
- The CCIT method is non-compendial and should also be validated for:
  - Precision (repeatability, intermediate precision, and reproducibility)
  - Robustness (capacity of method to remain unaffected by deliberate variations in method parameters)
- Provide complete CCIT method validation results for the proposed dye ingress method.
  - Refer to: FDA Guidance for Industry: Analytical Procedures and Methods Validation for Drugs and Biologics, 2015.

### 3. Commercial Manufacture of IMAB362

- You plan for commercial manufacture of IMAB362 drug product.
- Provide additional data and/or information to support that the facility is capable of manufacturing IMAB362 drug product reproducibly.
