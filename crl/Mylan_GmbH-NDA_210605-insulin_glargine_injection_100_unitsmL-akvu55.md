---

## Prescribing Information

Your proposed Prescribing Information (PI) must conform to the content and format regulations found at **21 CFR 201.56(a), (d)** and **201.57**.

### Reference Resources:
- [Physician Labeling Rule (PLR)](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)

### Required Updates:
1. In **IFU** labeling for pen injector:
   - Update text: "Step 8 Needle disposal" — reference appropriately throughout IFU.

2. Utilize the **SRPI checklist** to correct formatting before resubmission.

3. Submit updated content of labeling in SPL format.

4. Provide:
   - A clean Microsoft Word version  
   - A marked-up copy with annotations of proposed changes

## Instructions for Use (IFU) Revisions

Recommend the following IFU-Pen updates:

1. Clarify product and dosing info:
   ```
   Semglee is a prefilled disposable pen injector that contains a total of 300 units of insulin glargine.
   One pen contains multiple doses. Select doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit.
   If your prescribed dose is more than 80 units, you will need more than one injection.
   ```

2. Reposition needle disposal warning:
   Move following statement:  
   `Always store the Pen with the cap on, to prevent contamination. Do not leave the needle attached...`

3. Storage section enhancement:
   ```
   ### Storage

   **Unused Pens**
   - Store at 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C)
   - Do not freeze
   - Use before expiration date

   **In-use Pen**
   - Use at room temperature up to 86°F (30°C)
   - Do not refrigerate after first use
   - Discard after 28 days
   ```

4. Step 4: Dose selection
   - Add bullets:
     - The Pen dials 1 unit at a time
     - The Dose Knob clicks as you turn it
     - Do not count clicks
     - Even numbers printed; odd numbers shown as lines
   - Add image showing odd-dose dialed  
   - Add: "If more than 80 units needed, administer in two injections"

5. Step 5:
   ```
   Select the injection site as explained by your provider. Inject in arms, hips, thighs, buttocks, or abdomen.
   Rotate sites. Clean with alcohol wipe. Let dry before injection.
   ```

6. Step 6 (Injection):
   - Revise: After window shows “0,” hold button down and count to 10
