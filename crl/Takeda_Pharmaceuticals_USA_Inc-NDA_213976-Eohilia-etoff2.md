## NDA 213976  
**COMPLETE RESPONSE**  
**Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.**  
Attention: Matthew Wang, Pharm.D.  
Director, Global Regulatory Affairs  
40 Landsdowne Street  
Cambridge, MA 02139  

Dear Dr. Wang,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received October 15, 2020, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Eohilia (budesonide oral suspension).

We recognize that eosinophilic esophagitis is a rare and serious disease with a high unmet need and no approved therapies. In situations such as this one we must incorporate regulatory flexibility, while still ensuring there is substantial evidence of effectiveness. Based upon our review of your submitted data, we are unable to conclude that there is substantial evidence of effectiveness. As such, we have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## CLINICAL / STATISTICAL:

As was conveyed in the Filing Communication – Filing Review Issues Identified Letter dated December 14, 2020, and subsequently communicated in the Discipline Review Letter dated March 19, 2021, our review identified deficiencies with the ability of the submitted data to demonstrate the short- and long-term efficacy of BOS for the treatment of EoE. We have completed our review of NDA 213976, and have determined that neither the data submitted in the NDA, nor the data submitted to the NDA during review of the application, are adequate to support the demonstration of efficacy of BOS for the treatment of EoE in adult and adolescent patients 11 years and older.

1. The results from the evaluation of the symptomatic coprimary endpoint in trial SHP621-301, while statistically significant, were not representative of clinically meaningful change.
   - Concerns were noted regarding the ≥30% DSQ responder threshold.
   - Anchor-based analyses from SHP621-301 do not support the selected threshold as clinically meaningful.
   - Statistically significant response on the histologic endpoint was observed in SHP621-301.
   - However, lack of sustained histologic response in SHP621-302 makes the benefit unclear.
   - Inadequate data to demonstrate short-term histologic response predicts meaningful clinical outcomes.

2. Key secondary efficacy endpoint (absolute change from baseline in 14-day DSQ combined score in SHP621-301) did not show meaningful benefit:
   - Statistically significant but small treatment difference.
   - Not supported by the 7-day PGIS assessment.
   - 7-day DSQ did not demonstrate a treatment difference.

3. Long-term efficacy data is inadequate:
   - EoE is a chronic, relapsing condition and thus requires long-term efficacy support.
   - FDA communications under IND 103173 emphasizing need:
     - Nov 12, 2014 – Type B End-of-Phase 2 meeting
     - Jul 13, 2015 – Type C meeting
     - Nov 2, 2016 – Breakthrough Therapy Type B Meeting
     - Jun 25, 2019 – Type B Pre-NDA face-to-face
     - May 20, 2020 – Type B Pre-NDA teleconference
   - SHP621-302 did not yield statistically significant long-term efficacy results.

4. Post hoc subgroup analyses based on dilation status are inadequate:
   - Dilation status collected during screening, not reliably confirmed.
   - Identified subgroup post-unblinding and SAP completion.
   - DSQ combined score analysis in verified subgroup showed minimal separation between groups.

---

## INFORMATION NEEDED TO RESOLVE THE DEFICIENCIES:

- Design a new, adequate and well-controlled study including adolescents and adults with EoE.
- Include a prespecified subpopulation (e.g., without prior dilation, baseline severe dysphagia).
- Require medical record documentation for inclusion based on dilation status.
- Recommend:
  - Treatment period: at least 24 weeks
  - Total treatment duration: at least 52 weeks (includes extension) to characterize safety and durability
- Study should assess:
  - Prespecified symptomatic and histologic coprimary endpoints
  - Clinically meaningful patient-level DSQ score change using anchor-based methods such as PGIS
  - eCDF curves across treatment arms
- Complete this study before resubmitting the application.

We advise continued engagement with FDA under breakthrough therapy designation and anticipate potential advisory committee discussion in a future review cycle.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:

These issues are not approvability issues but require your attention:

1. **Food Effect Study**:
   - Not conducted with either phase 3 or to-be-marketed (TBM) formulation.
   - PK/safety under fed vs. fasted conditions unknown.
   - Conduct a dedicated food effect study and submit results.

2. **Dissolution Data**:
   - Limited data provided.
   - If new batches are manufactured, provide full-profile dissolution data (n=12).
   - If no new batches manufactured, upon approval provide full-profile dissolution data from first six commercial batches in your annual report.

## SAFETY UPDATE

Include the following information in the safety update per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b):

1. Significant changes/findings in the safety profile.
2. Incorporate new safety data:
   - Present new and combined data in tabular format.
   - Include comparison tables against original application.
   - Separate tables for other indications.
3. Retabulate reasons for early discontinuation, describe new patterns.
4. Provide:
   - Case report forms and narrative summaries for deaths or serious adverse events.
   - Narrative summaries for adverse events leading to discontinuation.
5. Note any significant changes in frequency of common adverse events.
6. Updated exposure data (e.g., person time, subject numbers).
7. Summary of worldwide safety experience and updated use estimates.
8. English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

---

## OTHER

You are required to resubmit or take action within one year per 21 CFR 314.110. Lack of response may be considered a request for withdrawal per 21 CFR 314.65.

- Any resubmission must fully address all deficiencies.
- Clearly mark submission with **"RESUBMISSION"**.
- Partial responses are not resubmissions and will not be processed.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with FDA to discuss next steps as described in the draft guidance for industry on formal meetings.
