## APPLICATION NUMBER:
761166Orig1s000

## OTHER ACTION LETTERS

### BLA 761166 - COMPLETE RESPONSE

PharmaEssentia Corporation  
Attention: Craig Zimmerman, PhD  
Vice President Medical and Drug Development  
35 Corporate Drive, Suite 325  
Burlington, MA 01803  

Dear Dr. Zimmerman:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated and received March 13, 2020, under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for P1101.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## HUMAN FACTORS

Based on the results of the human factors (HF) validation study data, root cause analysis, and participants’ subjective feedback, the proposed product design and user interface do not support safe and effective use of the product, as previously communicated to you in our October 15, 2020, correspondence regarding our review of your HF study results report.

We recommend that you:

- Implement our HF protocol recommendations stated in the HF validation study protocol advice letter dated February 26, 2021, prior to commencing your HF validation study  
- Consider additional design modifications and labeling changes  
- Submit the results of another HF validation study to demonstrate that the product can be used safely and effectively  

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the following websites:

- [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)  
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)  

Also consult the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) – a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Please refer to correspondence dated June 9, 2020, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Besremi. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle.

Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

Inspections of the following facilities are required before this application can be approved:

- PharmaEssentia Corporation, FEI 2000012832, Taichung, Taiwan  
- PharmaEssentia Corporation, FEI 3005182038, Taipei, Taiwan  

FDA must assess the ability of these facilities to conduct the listed manufacturing operations in compliance with CGMP. Due to restrictions on travel, the inspection could not be conducted during the current review cycle.

You may respond to deficiencies in this Complete Response Letter while travel restrictions remain in effect; however, the application cannot be approved until inspections are conducted and findings assessed.

For additional details, see the [FDA guidances related to COVID-19](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-related-guidance-documents-industry-fda-staff-and-other-stakeholders).

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When responding to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the product regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

Include the following:

1. Describe any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.  
2. Assemble sections describing:  
   - Discontinuations due to adverse events  
   - Serious adverse events  
   - Common adverse events  

   Incorporate new safety data as follows:  
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission  
   - Present tabulations of new safety data combined with original application data  
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the new data  
   - For other indications, provide separate tables of adverse event frequencies from clinical trials  

3. Provide a retabulation of reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating drop-outs from newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.  
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or discontinued due to an adverse event. Include narrative summaries for serious adverse events.  
5. Describe any information suggesting a substantial change in the incidence of common but less serious adverse events between new and original data.  
6. Provide updated exposure information (e.g., number of subjects, person-time).  
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience regarding product safety. Include updated estimate of use for product marketed in other countries.  
8. Provide English translations of currently approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.  

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:

1. Two batches of drug product were used to determine suitability of the in-process bioburden test method. Three batches should be used for testing method suitability in the bacteriostasis/fungistasis assay. Provide test method suitability results from one additional batch of P1101, 500 mcg/mL.  
2. One batch was used to determine sterility test method suitability by PharmaEssentia Corporation. Three batches are required for bacteriostasis/fungistasis assay. Provide sterility test method suitability results for two additional batches of P1101, 500 mcg/mL tested at PharmaEssentia Corporation.  

---

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions under 21 CFR 601.3(b). If no action is taken, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 601.3(c).

You may request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.

A resubmission must:

- Fully address all deficiencies listed in this letter  
- Be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large, bold font at the beginning of the cover letter  
- Clearly state that you consider the resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies  
- Note that a partial response will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle  

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss next steps toward approval. Submit the meeting request as described in the draft guidance for industry: *Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products*.

The drug product may not be legally marketed until we notify you in writing of approval of this application.

If you have any questions, call Carleveva Thompson, Regulatory Project Manager, at 301-796-1403.
