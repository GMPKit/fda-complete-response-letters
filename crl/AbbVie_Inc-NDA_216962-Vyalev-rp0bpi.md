## Additional Comments

### Carton Labeling

| Identified Issue | Rationale | Recommendation |
|------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Medication Guide (MG) statement not on PDP | Under 21 CFR 208.24(d), this must be prominent | Relocate MG statement to principal display panel (PDP) |

### Container Labeling

| Identified Issue | Rationale | Recommendation |
|------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Missing container closure term | May lead to confusion | Revise “10 mL single-dose” to “10 mL single-dose vial” |

## Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)

### Labeling for Infusion System (Vyafuser)

- Labeling lacks elements per FDA guidance on infusion pumps:
  - Information on head height and backpressure is missing
  - Labeling must support safe use by users

Refer to: [FDA Infusion Pump Guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/78369/download)

### Design Verification Testing

- Design inputs/outputs tested but does **not demonstrate**:
  - Accuracy throughout delivery time
  - Performance under environmental conditions (head height, backpressure)
- Lacks validation per **21 CFR §820.30(f)**

**Testing Recommendations:**

- Include initial 24-hour accuracy testing  
- Demonstrate performance across temperature, pressure, and viscosity ranges  
- Address flow accuracy at multiple flow rates including interactions (e.g., max temp + backpressure)  
- Specify flow accuracy duration (e.g., mL/day)  
- Test performance with cyclic and vibrational shock

---

## Instructions for Use

Reserved pending application satisfactoriness.

Use SRPI checklist for any future revisions:  
- Ensure PI compliance with 21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)  
- Submit in SPL format via [SP Labeling Submission Guide](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

## Medication Guide Statement

Include the following on carton and container labeling:  
`ATTENTION PHARMACIST: Each patient is required to receive the enclosed Medication Guide.`  

Per 21 CFR 208.24(d).

---

## Human Factors

If revising the product or user interface:

- Update URRA for new risks, tasks, or failure modes  
- Submit justification and comparative analyses  
- Submit revised URRA and HF-related documentation to FDA for feedback  

**Use error example:**

- Users failed to respond to alarms → loss of mobility  
  → Recommend alarm troubleshooting guide + helpline info added to pump  
  → Ensure consistency with Instructions for Use

---
