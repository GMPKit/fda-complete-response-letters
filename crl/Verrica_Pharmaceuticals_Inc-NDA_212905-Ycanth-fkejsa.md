## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

1. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

## PROPRIETARY NAME

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.  
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new data from studies for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Tabulate new safety data combined with original application data.
   - Provide tables comparing frequencies of adverse events between new and original submissions.
   - For other indications, offer separate tables of adverse event frequencies.
3. Retabulate reasons for premature trial discontinuation incorporating new dropouts; identify any new trends.
4. Submit case report forms and narrative summaries for patients who died during a clinical trial or discontinued due to adverse events, along with all serious adverse events (SAEs).
5. Highlight any substantial change in incidence of common but less serious adverse events compared to initial data.
6. Provide updated clinical exposure information (e.g., number of subjects, duration).
7. Summarize global safety experience and update estimates of international drug usage.
8. Submit English translations of any current approved foreign labeling not previously provided.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

1. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review relevant resources:
   - [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)
   - [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

   Reference the **Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI)** checklist to ensure your Prescribing Information conforms to regulations and guidance. Your response must include revised labeling in structured product labeling (SPL) format as [described here](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

Labeling and Human Factor comments and recommendations will be provided in separate correspondence.

---

## OTHER

Within one year from the date of this letter, you must either resubmit or take other available actions under 21 CFR 314.110. Failure to respond may be considered a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. You may also request an extension.

Any resubmission must fully address all deficiencies noted in this letter and must be clearly marked **"RESUBMISSION"** in bold font at the beginning of the cover letter. A partial response will not be processed as a resubmission and will not initiate a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference to clarify next steps. Submit your request per the draft guidance for industry *Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products*.

**Important:** The drug may not be legally marketed until a written notification of application approval is received.

## COMPLETE RESPONSE

**Submitted by Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.**  
**Attention:** Patti Neall  
**Executive Director, Regulatory Affairs**  
10 N. High Street, Suite 200  
West Chester, PA 19380  

We have completed our review and cannot approve this application in its current form. Reasons for this action are detailed below.

We acknowledge receipt of amendments submitted May 15 and 29; June 5 and 11, 2020. These were not reviewed for this action.

---

### PRODUCT QUALITY

1. The proposed specification lacks tests critical for safe and accurate application on lesion sites. Revisions should include:
   - Crushing force test for glass ampule.
   - Leakage test post-crushing to confirm seal integrity through shelf life.
   - Droplet size/volume test for accurate dosing that spares healthy skin.

2. Extraction solutions used in extractable/leachable studies are inadequate for evaluation.

---

### HUMAN FACTORS

11. The Human Factors (HF) validation study identified use errors related to the critical task ‘Break the Ampule’:

   - One user removed cap and sleeve, then inverted and broke the ampule using both hands.
   - Three users struggled to break the ampule, needing two hands; one tilted the applicator.

   **Issue:** This unmitigated task poses a risk of accidental exposure.

   - Heuristic analysis (April 10, 2020) shows average palmar pinch force (females) is 16 lbs vs. 19 lbs required when using paperboard sleeve—exceeding ergonomic norms.
   - Comparative evaluations with **Eskata** and **Levulan Kerastick** show Kerastick's interface (e.g., Krusher device) alters risk profile.
   - Postmarketing data for Eskata suggests risk of exposure; therefore, using it as reference is not acceptable.

   **Conclusion:** Product is not safe for HCP use without design improvements and mitigation strategies.

   **Required Actions:**
   - Redesign device to mitigate use errors.
   - Submit revised HF validation protocol (60-day review period).

   **Additional Recommendations:**
   a. Leverage design insights from Levulan Kerastick.  
   b. Enhance Instructions for Use (IFU) readability and safety emphasis.  
   c. Reclassify tasks such as:
      - Inspect Applicator  
      - Apply Solution  
      - Allow Solution to Dry  
      - Remove Cap (timing risk unevaluated)

## SAFETY UPDATE

**Same requirements reiterated:**  

14. Describe any significant changes in safety profile.  
15. Add new data addressing:
   - AE-related discontinuations  
   - Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
   - Common Adverse Events with:
     - Side-by-side tabulations comparing new vs. original data  
     - Separate tables by indication  
16. Retabulate reasons for premature discontinuations with trend analysis.  
17. Submit complete case report forms and narratives for deaths and serious adverse events.  
18. Highlight changes in less serious but common adverse events.  
19. Provide updated subject exposure totals and person-time metrics.  
20. Summarize global usage and adverse event profiles.  
21. Submit translated labeling from other countries not yet reviewed.
