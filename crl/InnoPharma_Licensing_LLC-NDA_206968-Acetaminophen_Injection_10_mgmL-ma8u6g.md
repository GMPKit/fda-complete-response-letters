## 7. CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING DEFICIENCIES

| Identified Issue | Rationale | Recommendation |
|------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Strength written as “1000 mg” | May be misread as 100 | Use comma: “1,000 mg” |
| Lack of expiry date/lot number placement on label | May confuse users | Clearly label expiration date, lot number, with format YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MMM-DD |
| Overwrap label missing expiration date format | Risk of misinterpretation | Specify expiration format as above |
| Net quantity (100 mL) competes with strength for prominence | May confuse users | Reduce prominence of quantity statement |
| Missing temperature units on storage statement | May be misread | Use “20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F)” |
| Missing dosage strength on carton | Incomplete drug info | State: “1,000 mg per 100 mL (10 mg/mL)” |
| Missing route of administration | Risk of misadministration | Add: “For Intravenous Use Only” |
| Misleading quantity statement | Affects accurate dispensing | Remove misleading statement |
| Missing “Rx Only” | Required by section 503(b)(4)(A) | Add an “Rx Only” statement without interfering with essential product ID |
| 2D barcode present but no serial number | DSCSA compliance | Clarify inclusion of serial number; see FDA draft guidance on product identifiers |
