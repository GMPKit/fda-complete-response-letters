Silver Spring, MD 20993  

**NDA 208969**  
**COMPLETE RESPONSE**  

**To:**  
Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
11570 6th Street  
Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730  
Attention: Gisela Sharp  
Senior Manager, Regulatory Affairs  

**Subject:** Naloxone Nasal Spray  

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated April 18, 2016, received April 19, 2016, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Naloxone Nasal Spray.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated February 7, 2017, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

### 1. Human Factors Validation Study

Based on the results of the human factors (HF) validation study, the product user interface does not support a conclusion that all intended users can use this product safely and effectively.

> 1 Page(s) has been Withheld in Full as B4 (CCI/TS) immediately following this page.

---

### 4. Pediatric Administration Concerns

Administration of the proposed formulation has the potential to lead to run-off into the posterior pharynx, especially in the youngest pediatric patients, raising safety concerns surrounding respiratory complications due to aspiration and effectiveness concerns due to inadequate absorption of naloxone. The pediatric assessment does not adequately address these concerns to support use of the product down to birth.

**Information needed to resolve deficiency:**  
Because your product may be administered to someone other than the prescription recipient, including children, your application must support the use of the product in all age ranges, including children down to birth. Consider re-formulating your product for use in adults and pediatric patients down to birth.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) — a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the prescribing information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances.

Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:  
http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

During a recent inspection of the International Medication Systems Limited (FEI 2016148) manufacturing facility for this application, our field investigator conveyed device (21 CFR 820) deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. When assembling the sections describing:
   - discontinuations due to adverse events,
   - serious adverse events, and
   - common adverse events,  

   Incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. You may also request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial response to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your meeting request as described in the draft FDA Guidance for Industry, “Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products,” March 2015:  
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm437431.pdf
