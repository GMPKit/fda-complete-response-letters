Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated January 4, 2013, received January 4, 2013, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for:

> TechneGen Generator System for Preparation of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc99m Injection (Sodium Pertechnetate Tc99m Injection USP)

We acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated:  
January 18, 22, 23, and 28  
February 15

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

There are multiple deficiencies in the product labeling, including the user manuals, training materials, and package insert related to instructions for preparation and safe use of the TechneGen system.

- These deficiencies have prevented the full evaluation of the safety of the TechneGen generator system.
- Refer to the meeting minutes from the teleconference on July 17, 2013, for detailed discussion and recommendations on:
  - Revising user manuals and training materials.
  - Designing and conducting a human factor testing study.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY MICROBIOLOGY

1. The safety of the TechneGen cannot currently be evaluated from a microbiological perspective due to insufficient sterility assurance data.
2. Missing data to demonstrate microbiological control of the system over the in-use period.
3. You must demonstrate tubing, valves, and connectors can be used without increased microbial contamination risk.
   - Address risk of biofilm formation.
   - Discuss issues like leaking/encrusted connections.
4. Application does not justify the claim that the TechneGen system is a closed process.
5. Cleaning protocol has not been validated to remove contaminating organisms.
6. No confirmation that final patient dosage form has been sterilized.
   - Sterilizing filter must be integrity tested prior to drug product release.
   - Include test methods, acceptance criteria, and user instructions for test failure.
7. Process validation studies are inadequate.
   - No aseptic processing simulations by the end user.
8. Provide English translations of appendices 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 15 to sterilization validation report 77C01891.
9. Provide description of materials 1320 and 1516 used in the manufacturing process.
10. Manufacturing info needed on vial components:
    - Summary of environmental monitoring and room classifications.
    - The proposed facility for commercial use.
    - Methods and controls for monitoring production.
    - Statement on whether reprocessing is allowed.
11. Provide testing protocol and schedule for 99m injection of intended quality.
12. Clarify how labeling issues due to high volumes/low activity from TechneGen generators (e.g., Ceretec radiolabeling) will be addressed.
13. Amend post-approval stability protocol:
    - Indicate one lot annually with largest Mo99 source size.
    - Add that data will be submitted in the NDA annual report.
14. DMF #26592 referenced is deficientâ€”deficiencies must be resolved before approval.
15. Manufacturing facility is not adequately ready.

## LABELING

Comment is reserved until application is otherwise adequate.  
If labeling is revised, include updated content in SPL format per [FDA guidelines](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

---

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

- Inspection of manufacturing facility revealed deficiencies.
  - These must be satisfactorily resolved prior to approval.
- NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes, LLC and other related facilities were not ready for inspection.
  - Notify FDA in writing when facilities are inspection-ready.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

In your response, include a safety update as described in 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b):

1. Describe significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. Present new safety data:
   - Use original NDA format.
   - Include combined tabulations with original data.
   - Compare frequencies of adverse events.
   - Provide separate tables for non-proposed indications.
3. Retabulate reasons for premature trial discontinuations, include new data.
4. Provide:
   - Case report forms.
   - Narrative summaries for deaths and adverse-eventâ€“related discontinuations.
   - Narrative summaries for serious adverse events.
5. Describe substantial changes in incidence of common but less serious adverse events.
6. Provide updated exposure information (e.g., number of subjects, person-time).
7. Summarize worldwide safety experience.
   - Include updated estimate of usage in other countries.
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.
