Dear Ms. Rudnick:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received September 21, 2017, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Cocaine Hydrochloride Topical Solution, 4% and 10%.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated June 28, 2018, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

1. You have not provided adequate information to characterize the effects of your product on the QT<sub>c</sub> interval.

   **To resolve this deficiency:**
   - Submit the results of a thorough QT study.

---

## NONCLINICAL

2. You have not provided adequate leachables evaluation to justify the safety of the proposed container closure system.

   Specifically:
   - Your leachables evaluation did not evaluate at least three batches of your to-be-marketed drug product.
   - It did not include assessments at multiple timepoints over the course of your stability studies.
   - You have not provided an adequate extractables-leachables correlation.

   **To resolve this deficiency:**
   - Conduct a new leachables study under standard storage conditions evaluating at least three batches of the to-be-marketed product.
   - Include assessments at beginning, middle, and end of proposed shelf-life.
   - Evaluate all container closure systems intended for market.
   - Delineate how extraction studies informed your leachables assessment.
   - Submit a toxicological assessment for any leachable that exceeds 5 mcg/day, considering the maximum daily dose.
   - Submit a discussion of the extractables-leachables correlation.

3. Several of your final study reports did not report the purity of the test articles.

   **To resolve this deficiency:**
   - Revise the final study reports for Study 16-01138-G2, 16-01139-G2, and 16-01140-G2 to include purity information of the test articles evaluated.

## REGULATORY

4. Your annotated draft labeling does not identify the sources of the proposed language.

   **To resolve this deficiency:**
   - If relying on published non-U.S. studies, you may be able to rely upon that literature.
   - If relying on the Agency's previous findings for a listed drug, identify these drugs per 21 CFR 314.54.
   - Include appropriate patent certification or statement for each listed drug.
   - Establish a scientific bridge between your product and each listed drug (e.g., comparative bioavailability data).
   - Submit revised labeling.
   - Identify the appropriate source(s) of information upon which you propose to rely.
