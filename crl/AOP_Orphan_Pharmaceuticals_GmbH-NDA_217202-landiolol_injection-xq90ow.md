## POSTMARKETING REQUIREMENTS UNDER 505(o)(3)

Per section 505(o)(3) of the FDCA, you must conduct postmarket assessments. You have not evaluated the inhibition potential of landiolol and its M1 metabolite on important drug transporters, including:

- P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
- Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)
- Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3)
- Organic cation transporter (OCT2)
- Multidrug and toxin extrusion transporters (MATE1, MATE2-K)
- Organic anion transporters (OAT1, OAT3)

We find analyses under 505(k)(1) and 505(k)(3) insufficient.

### Required Postmarket Study

You must conduct an **in vitro** study to assess whether landiolol and M1 inhibit:

- P-gp
- BCRP
- OATP1B1
- OATP1B3
- OCT2
- MATE1
- MATE2-K
- OAT1
- OAT3
