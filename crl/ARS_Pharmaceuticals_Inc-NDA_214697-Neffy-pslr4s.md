## CLINICAL/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

### Deficiency

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency and approval for this indication, in the absence of clinical efficacy trials, requires a high level of confidence in the PK/PD results under conditions likely to be encountered by the target population. Since PK/PD data were not obtained from subjects with anaphylaxis, a nasal allergen challenge approach was agreed upon to reflect changes in the nasal mucosa that may be present in some patients with anaphylaxis; these changes may impact absorption of ARS-1.

In addition, proposed labeling for ARS-1, in alignment with labeling for approved epinephrine injection products, recommends administration of a second dose for patients with severe persistent anaphylaxis. The submitted data do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness for the use of ARS-1 (epinephrine nasal spray) for its proposed indication.

The single dose ARS-1 PK/PD comparison to single dose epinephrine injection products in subjects with allergen-induced acute rhinitis (EPI 16) raises concerns regarding the durability of the drug’s effect under such conditions.

### Information to Resolve Deficiency

To resolve the above deficiency, provide PK/PD data assessing repeat doses of ARS-1 compared to repeat doses of epinephrine injection product(s) under allergen-induced allergic rhinitis conditions. Include an assessment of PK/PD findings when the second dose of ARS-1 is administered in both the ipsilateral and contralateral naris.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

### Deficiency

FDA expects manufacturers and applicants to ascertain the presence of Nitrosamine Drug Substance-Related Impurities (NDSRIs) in their drug products. FDA has recommended, in guidance, a 3-step mitigation strategy:

1. Conduct risk assessments for nitrosamines in APIs and drug products  
2. Conduct confirmatory testing if risks are identified  
3. Report changes implemented to prevent or reduce the presence of nitrosamine impurities  

- Refer to: [FDA Guidance on Recommended Acceptable Intake Limits for NDSRIs](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recommended-acceptable-intake-limits-nitrosamine-drug-substance-related-impurities)

Alternatively, provide a scientifically justified rationale to pursue an AI limit different than the FDA recommended AI limit associated with N-nitroso-epinephrine.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

Refer to FDA's labeling review resources:

- [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)  
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)  

When revising labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure it conforms with regulations and guidances. Submit updated labeling in structured product labeling (SPL) format.

- [Structured Product Labeling Guidance](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

### DEVICE

You submitted cytotoxicity, sensitization, and irritation testing for the Aptar device constituent of the combination product. However, you did not provide adequate irritation testing.

Please provide:

- Methods and results of irritation testing (suggested standard: ISO 10993-10)  
- Refer to the FDA’s biocompatibility guidance:  
  [Use of ISO 10993-1](https://www.fda.gov/media/85865/download)

### OTHER

We note that on June 12, 2023, Viatris Inc. submitted a citizen petition to FDA (Docket No. FDA-2023-P-2392) regarding Neffy (NDA 214697). The issues are under review by the Agency and do not represent a final decision on the NDA or the citizen petition.

## NEXT STEPS

You are required to resubmit or take other actions within one year of this letter [21 CFR 314.110(b)]. Failure to respond may be considered a request for withdrawal [21 CFR 314.110(c)].

You may request an extension of time. A resubmission must:

- Fully address all the deficiencies  
- Be clearly marked "RESUBMISSION" in bold at the cover letter's beginning  
- Clearly state this is a complete response  

A partial response will not initiate a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss next steps. Submit a meeting request as described in the draft guidance:  
_Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products_

The drug product may not be legally marketed until the FDA has approved the application.
