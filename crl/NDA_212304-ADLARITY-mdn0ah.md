## General Comments

**(Overpack Professional Sample; Container [Pouch] Labels and Carton Labeling; Trade and Professional Sample; 5 mg/hour and 10 mg/hour)**

1. The NDC numbers are denoted by a placeholder. Therefore, we are unable to assess the proposed NDC numbers from a medication safety perspective. You should add the proposed NDC numbers to the labels and labeling for our review and comment.

2. As currently presented on the labels and labeling, the product strength is not consistently expressed and may lead to misinterpretation. You should ensure the strength is expressed as “xx mg/day” wherever it appears on the labels and labeling to avoid confusion.

3. The expiration date format is not defined on the container label and carton labeling. To minimize confusion and reduce the risk for deteriorated product medication errors, identify the format you intend to use. The Agency recommends that the human-readable expiration date on the product package label include a year, month, and non-zero day. Additionally, the Agency recommends that the expiration date appear in `YYYY-MM-DD` format if only numerical characters are used or in `YYYY-MMM-DD` if alphabetical characters are used to represent the month. If there are space limitations on the product package, the human-readable text may include only a year and month, to be expressed as: `YYYY-MM` if only numerical characters are used or `YYYY-MMM` if alphabetical characters are used. A hyphen or a space may be used to separate the portions of the expiration date.

4. The usual dosage statement is not present on the labels and labeling. The usual dosage statement is required per 21 CFR 201.55. We recommend that you revise the container labels and carton labeling to read:

   > “Recommended dosage: See prescribing information and Instructions for Use for dosing and application instructions.”

5. We note the product has heat exposure limitations. Specifically, the Prescribing Information (Section 2.4 and Section 17) states that long exposure to external heat sources (e.g., excessive sunlight, saunas, solariums, or heating pads) should be avoided. However, the container labels and carton labeling do not contain this warning. Add a statement such as “Avoid applying heat” or a similar statement to the principal display panel of the labels and labeling.

6. The storage statement on the container labels and carton labeling is inconsistent with that presented in the Prescribing Information labeling. For increased comprehension by lay users, we recommend the storage statement be revised.

## Carton Labeling (Overpack, Professional Sample, 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day)

1. The readability of the net quantity statement can be improved. Consider revising the net quantity statement to read:

   > “Contains sample packs. Each sample pack contains one system.”

---

## Instructions for Use (IFU)

1. As currently presented in Step 1, the illustration identifying possible locations for the patch may be misinterpreted to mean that a patch should be applied to more than one site and could result in an overdose. We recommend you consider the labeling of other transdermal systems (e.g., that for rivastigmine) as you determine how best to depict acceptable sites for patch application.

## Proprietary Name

Please refer to correspondence dated September 19, 2019, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, **ADLARITY**. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

## Safety Update

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug/product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, you should incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the re-tabulated frequencies described above.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for:
   - Each patient who died during a clinical trial
   - Each patient who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event
   - Serious adverse events

5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person-time).

7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug/product. Include an updated estimate of use for drug/product marketed in other countries.

8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## Other

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65.

You may also request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly marked with:

> "RESUBMISSION"

…in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial response to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your meeting request as described in the draft guidance for industry:  
**Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products**.

The drug product may not be legally marketed until you have been notified in writing that this application is approved.

If you have any questions, contact:
