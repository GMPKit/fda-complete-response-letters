# COMPLETE RESPONSE – NDA 209388

**Center for Drug Evaluation and Research**  
**Application Number:** 209388Orig1s000  
**Sponsor:** Evoke Pharma, Inc.  
**Drug:** Gimoti (metoclopramide nasal spray)  
**Date:** April 1, 2019

## Clinical Pharmacology

Your pharmacokinetic (PK) bridge between the Gimoti 15 mg dose and the Reglan tablet 10 mg is insufficient to justify reliance on Reglan's safety and efficacy data for Gimoti.

**Concerns:**
- Unreliable and inconsistent delivery of metoclopramide.
- Several subjects had low Cmax (<5 ng/ml) with one or more Gimoti administrations.
- This issue was not observed with Reglan.

### Recommendations to Address Deficiencies:
- Investigate root causes for PK variability with Gimoti.
- Analyze inconsistent/incomplete delivery issues.
- Provide evidence with mitigation strategies.
- Additional in vitro and/or in vivo studies may be required.

---

## Product Quality / Device Quality

Your proposed specification for the drug product is inadequate, with insufficient evidence to ensure that quality control and essential performance characteristics do not contribute to clinical variability.

**Specific Issue:**
- Droplet size distribution method and acceptance criterion are not robust.
- Inadequate justification for proposed ranges given observed PK variability.

### Recommendations to Address Deficiencies:
- Submit product specification supported by 3 batches manufactured:
  - Using selected commercial formulation and strength.
  - With the commercial device.
  - At the proposed commercial manufacturing site and process.
  - Tested with validated analytical methods at the proposed analytical site.

---

## Additional Comments

### Product Quality / Device Quality

A. Include a test and acceptance criterion for actuation force in product release and stability specification.
   - Provide verification/validation data.
   - Explain suitability for intended user population, or justify exclusion.

B. Define an upper acceptable cap removal force to ensure usability.

C. Proposed shelf-life is unsupported.
   - Submit data from three batches using commercial formulation/device upon resubmission.

D. It is premature to agree to a reduced reporting category for an additional release and stability facility.

### Clinical Pharmacology

E. We recommend that you develop a lower dosage strength to address dosage adjustment needs.

## Prescribing Information

We reserve comment on labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

- Review PLR requirements and the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule.
- Refer to Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) checklist.
- Include updated labeling in Structured Product Labeling (SPL) format, per [FDA SPL Guidance](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

---

## Proprietary Name

Refer to correspondence dated August 7, 2018, regarding the proposed proprietary name, Gimoti.

- Name was found acceptable pending approval.
- Resubmit upon addressing the application deficiencies.

---

## Safety Update

When responding to the deficiencies, include a safety update per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b).

1. Describe significant changes in the safety profile.
2. Update safety data for the proposed indication:
   - Format consistent with original submission.
   - Include tabulated data and comparisons with original data.
   - Provide separate tables for other indications.
3. Present updated reasons for trial discontinuation.
4. Include case report forms and narrative summaries for:
   - Deaths during trials.
   - Subjects who discontinued due to adverse events.
   - Serious adverse events.
5. Describe changes in incidence of common adverse events.
6. Provide updated exposure data.
7. Provide global safety experience and usage data.
8. Submit current approved foreign labeling translations.

## Other

You must resubmit or take other actions within one year from the date of this letter per 21 CFR 314.110. A lack of response may be considered a withdrawal request under 21 CFR 314.65.
