## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING  
We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

## MEDICATION GUIDE

## SAFETY UPDATE  

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update. The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile and their relevance, if any, to whether there may be clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar product and the U.S.-licensed reference product.
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the clinical studies for the proposed indication using the same format as the original BLA submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original BLA data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original BLA with the retabulated frequencies described above.
3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature study discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed studies. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each subject who died during a clinical study or who did not complete a study because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original BLA data.
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies (e.g., number of subjects, person time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this product, including adverse events known to be associated with the use of the product and immunogenicity. Include an updated estimate of use for this product marketed in other countries.
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## OTHER  
Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 601.3(b).
