Dear Ms. Caballero:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated May 15, 2019, received May 15, 2019, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for **SUTAB** (sodium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, and potassium chloride) tablets.

### PRODUCT QUALITY/FACILITY INSPECTION DEFICIENCIES

During a recent inspection of the Braintree Laboratories, Inc., MA (FEI1000513636) manufacturing facility for this application, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this NDA may be approved.

### PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the following websites:

1. [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)
2. [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)

These include related regulations, guidance documents, and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) âˆ’ a checklist of important format items.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidance. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at [FDA.gov](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

### SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described in 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.
3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who:
   - Died during a clinical trial, or
   - Did not complete a trial because of an adverse event.  
   Additionally, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common but less serious adverse events between the new data and the original application data.
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.
