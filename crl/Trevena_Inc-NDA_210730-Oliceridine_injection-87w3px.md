Dear Mr. Kirsch,

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received November 2, 2017, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Oliceridine injection, 1 mg/mL.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated October 31, 2018, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## Clinical

### 1. QT Prolongation Concerns

You have not submitted adequate data to support the safety of oliceridine for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in adult patients for whom an intravenous (IV) opioid is warranted due to concerns related to QT prolongation.

Details:

- Your thorough QT (tQT) study, CP130-1008, showed single doses of oliceridine prolong the QTcF in a dose-dependent manner with delayed onset:
  - 3 mg: 6.6 ms (upper 90% CI: 8.9 ms)
  - 6 mg: 11.6 ms (upper 90% CI: 13.7 ms)
- The proposed mechanism for delayed QTcF prolongation remains unclear.
- Limited ECG monitoring in Phase 3 studies:
  - Study 3001: 1, 24, and 48 hours post-loading dose
  - Study 3002: 1 and 24 hours
  - Study 3003: 1 hour and every 24 hours
- Proposed maximum daily dose: 40 mg
- Inadequate support that QTc prolongation risks can be mitigated by labeling/monitoring

**Information Needed to Resolve the Deficiency:**

Provide data from a randomized, active-controlled study with:

- 24-hour Holter monitoring
- Replicate QT measurements hourly
- Reliable evaluation of QT prolongation effects of oliceridine
- Adequate duration and sample size

---

### 2. Exposure Database Size

The submitted exposure database is not adequate for evaluating patients exposed to the highest doses or longest durations.

- Maximum 24-hour dose with ≥350 patients: 27 mg
- Highest dose over ≥35.5 hours with ≥350 patients: 37.2 mg

**Information Needed to Resolve the Deficiency:**

Provide an exposure database that includes at least 350 patients exposed to the highest proposed dose for the longest duration.

---

## Nonclinical

### 3. Embryo-Fetal Development and Metabolite TRV0109662

- Inadequate characterization of TRV0109662 in rats and rabbits
- No data submitted confirming formation in rabbits
- In rats, acceptable levels not formed compared to humans
- Incurred sample reanalysis failed in pivotal study

**Information Needed to Resolve the Deficiency:**

- Conduct a dedicated embryo-fetal development study with TRV0109662  
  OR  
- Provide validated, reproducible pharmacokinetic data showing existing animal studies resulted in ≥50% metabolite exposure compared to human levels at 40 mg/day

---

## Product Quality

### 4. Analytical Methods for Leachables

- Analytical methods used for controlling identified leachables not validated
- Validation reports were not provided to the Agency

**Information Needed to Resolve the Deficiency:**

- Validate analytical methods per ICH Q2
- Provide validation reports
- Provide data for leachables found in stability samples analyzed using the new methods

---

## Prescribing Information

- FDA reserves comment until the application is otherwise adequate
- Review PLR Requirements and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule resources
- Use SRPI checklist to ensure formatting compliance
- Updated labeling must be in SPL format:  
  [SPL Guidance](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

## Container Labels, Carton Labeling, and Proprietary Name

### Revisions Required

1. Remove "OLINVO" from container/carton labels.
2. Resubmit "OLINVYK" proprietary name (acceptable pending approval).
3. Use different NDC package codes on carton vs. container labels.
4. Place "Discard unused portion" directly after overfill statement.
5. Revise negative warning statements to affirmative form such as "Protect from freezing."
6. Define expiration date format clearly:
   - Recommended: DDMMMYYYY / MMMYYYY / YYYY-MM-DD
7. Remove inconsistent product strength statements.
8. Revise product use statements to:
   - “FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY” or “FOR INTRAVENOUS USE”
   - Consider relocating "Sterile" and "Rx only"
9. Ensure labeling consistency across all strengths (e.g., 30 mg/30 mL discrepancies).

---

## Safety Update

Include safety update per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b):

1. Describe significant changes/findings in safety profile.
2. Format safety data as per original submission.
3. Combine new and original safety data in tabulations.
4. Compare frequencies of adverse events.
5. Separate tables for non-indication trials.
6. Retabulate reasons for premature discontinuation.
7. Provide:
   - Case report forms
   - Narrative summaries for deaths and serious adverse events
8. Highlight changes in non-serious adverse event frequency.
9. Update exposure data (subjects, person-time).
10. Summarize global post-marketing safety experience.
11. Submit English translations of approved foreign labeling.

---

## Other

- Resubmit or address deficiencies per 21 CFR 314.110 within one year.
- Failure to respond may be considered a withdrawal request (21 CFR 314.65).
- Time extension may be requested.

### Resubmission Requirements

- Fully address all deficiencies.
- Clearly mark submission with **"RESUBMISSION"**.
- State that the response constitutes a complete response.
- Partial responses will not be accepted for new review cycle.

Meeting or teleconference requests should be submitted as per:
