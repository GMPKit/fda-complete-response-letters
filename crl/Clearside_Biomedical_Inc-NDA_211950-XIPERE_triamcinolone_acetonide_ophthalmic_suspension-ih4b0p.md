Alpharetta, GA 30005

Dear Ms. Bauschka:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received December 19, 2018, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), for XIPERE (triamcinolone acetonide ophthalmic suspension) for suprachoroidal injection.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## COMPLETE RESPONSE

1. **Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) Compliance**  
   The methods and facilities for manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding the drug substance and drug product must adhere to cGMP regulations (21 CFR 210 and 211).  
   - Objectionable conditions were observed at the manufacturing site during the pre-approval inspection.  
   - These issues must be satisfactorily resolved or alternative, compliant facilities included in the application.

2. **Insufficient Product Information**  
   There is inadequate information to determine the safety of the product under the proposed conditions of use.  
   - Submit clinical use data supporting the use of the final, to-be-marketed SCS Microinjector Delivery System.  
   - At least three physicians must evaluate the final configuration in no fewer than 30 patients.

3. **Process Robustness and Quality Data**  
   Submit data from three new registration batches produced via the proposed commercial process to confirm process robustness and product quality. At minimum, provide data for one batch with:
   - 3 months of long-term storage stability data  
   - 3 months of accelerated condition stability data

4. **Patent Certification Compliance (21 CFR 314.60(f))**  
   Amendment(s) made to your application may not comply with the patent certification requirements introduced by the final rule effective December 5, 2016.  
   - Affected amendments must include a proper patent certification or a “recertification.”  
   - Submit a list of all amendments post-December 5, 2016, and for each:  
     - Indicate inclusion of required patent certification/statement, or  
     - Verify that the amendment type does not necessitate certification per regulation.

   Future correspondence should continue to address requirements under 21 CFR 314.60(f).

## OTHER

You are required to resubmit or take other specified action within one year of the date of this letter, per 21 CFR 314.110. Failure to do so may be interpreted as a request to withdraw the NDA under 21 CFR 314.65. You may request an extension to resubmit.

A complete response must address **all** deficiencies listed in this letter and be clearly marked as **"RESUBMISSION"** in bold at the top of the cover letter. Partial responses will not be processed as resubmissions and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference to clarify necessary steps for approval. Submit your request in accordance with the draft guidance _Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products_.

The drug product may not be legally marketed until written approval is granted for this application.

If you have any questions, call Michael Puglisi, Regulatory Project Manager, at (301) 796-0791.

Sincerely,  
*Wiley A. Chambers, M.D.*
