Dear Dr. Joy:

Please refer to your Biologics License Application (BLA) dated August 27, 2015, and its amendments, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act for LA-EP2006.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. Below are our reasons for this decision and our recommendations where applicable.

---

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

1. You have not demonstrated PK similarity between LA-EP2006 and US-licensed Neulasta.  
   - Recommend conducting further root cause analyses to identify contributing factors.

2. You have not demonstrated PK similarity between LA-EP2006, US-licensed Neulasta, and EU-approved Neulasta.  
   - As a result, you have not established the PK component of the scientific bridge.  
   - Without an adequate scientific bridge, there is insufficient data to support biosimilarity.

3. Upon identifying root causes, conduct a feasibility assessment to determine whether development of LA-EP2006 under section 351(k) of the PHS Act remains viable.

4. If feasibility assessment supports continued development:  
   - Consider an adequately designed study demonstrating PK and PD similarity of LA-EP2006 and US-licensed Neulasta in healthy subjects.  
   - Recommend a cross-over 3-arm study design (LA-EP2006, US-licensed Neulasta, EU-approved Neulasta).  
   - Base sample size estimations on expected mean AUC and Cmax differences and publicly available PK variability data for pegylated G-CSF.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

1. The maximum filling duration has not been validated via media fills.  
   - Provide media fill data from three successful runs including representative manipulations and interventions during LA-EP2006 filling process.  
   - Specify the container-closure system used.

2. Insufficient data were provided to support the requalification strategy.  
   - Address comments and update section 3.2.P.3.5 of the BLA accordingly.

3. Insufficient microbial challenge data were provided for validation studies.  
   - Address comments described in amendment 0024 (Module 1.2, Annex 01).  
   - Update Section 3.2.P.3.5 of the BLA accordingly.

4. The method validation for dye ingress CCI test is inadequate.  
   - A vial was used instead of a PFS as positive control.  
   - Conduct a new CCI qualification study for LA-EP2006 PFS using a sensitive method detecting breaches <20 Î¼m using compromised syringes.  
   - Routine dye ingress CCI testing should include at least one compromised PFS unit as system suitability control.

5. Insufficient data from simulated air transportation study.  
   - Provide summary data demonstrating performance during worst-case air transport conditions.  
   - Also provide:  
     - Study protocol  
     - Study report  
     - Justification for study acceptance criteria

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

These are not deficiencies, but recommendations.

### Product Quality

1. If clinical PK differences relate to purity:
   - Conduct in vitro G-CSF receptor studies with variant species  
   - Assess serum/protease effects on stability and impurity function

2. SEC and RP-HPLC identity tests:
   - Add quantitative limits to relative peak retention times  
   - Express relative to reference standard

3. Include accelerated stability conditions in annual commitments for drug substance and product.
