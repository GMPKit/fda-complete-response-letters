## Clinical

### 1. Lack of Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness

- Results of clinical investigations show the product is not safe and risks outweigh benefits.
- Based on:
  - 5.4-month improvement in median hepatic progression-free survival
  - 3-month improvement in progression-free survival
  - Detrimental effect on overall survival
  - 7% incidence of toxic death
  - Serious cardiovascular, hepatic, gastrointestinal, and bone marrow toxicities

To address this:
- Conduct adequate and well-controlled clinical trial(s)
- Efficacy should be determined by overall survival
- Trial(s) must apply to the U.S. population

### 2. Device Configuration Mismatch

- Efficacy data from other versions of the device are not applicable
- Provide data using proposed commercial product demonstrating substantial evidence of effectiveness

---

## Clinical Pharmacology

### 3. Pharmacokinetic Profile Inadequate

- Insufficient information to characterize pharmacokinetics of melphalan
- Prior Alkeran studies are not sufficient

To address this:
- Submit data from clinical trials using proposed marketed combination product
- Collect melphalan PK samples sufficient for systemic exposure profiling, special population characterization

---

## Product Quality (Melblez Constituent Part)

### 4. Inadequate Testing Methodologies

- Missing or insufficient testing of:
  - Extractables and leachables
  - In-use stability
  - Melphalan adsorption

Submit:
- GC and HPLC methodologies
- Method validation summaries as per ICH Q2(R1) for:
  - Leachables testing
  - Simulated in-use stability
  - Adsorption testing

---

## Product Quality (Delcath Hepatic Delivery System Constituent Part)

### 5. Inadequate Toxicological Risk Assessment

- Missing comprehensive toxicological assessment of leachables
- Acceptance criteria based on clinical trial device not valid

Submit:
- New toxicological risk assessment for commercial configuration
- Leachable profile in nonpolar solvents
- Properly justified acceptance criteria
- Extractable profile of filter housing material

### 6. Biocompatibility Testing of Filter Media

Submit:
- Cytotoxicity, sensitization, hemolysis testing using appropriate extraction ratio  
- Alternatively, provide justification that such testing is unnecessary

### 7. Complement Activation Testing

- Explain division of groups in study 160944  
- If filter media not tested, submit C3-a and SC5b-9 testing for filter media alone

### 8. Circuit Components in Testing

- Identify all components included as part of the circuit in biocompatibility testing

### 9. Pressure Testing

- Insufficient information on pre- and post-filter pressure

Provide:
- Maximum allowable pressures  
- Justification for acceptance criteria

### 10. Colorants in Device Components

Device components with systemic blood contact lack required information.  

Submit:
- Chemical name and CAS number  
- Amount per device  
- Size range  
- Purity level  
- Release capability  
- MSDS  
- List of other devices using the same colorants  
- Toxicity assessment or rationale for exemption  

### 15. Shelf Life Validation

- Current shelf life based only on inadequate accelerated aging

To address:
- Base shelf life on real-time testing or provide correlation validation for accelerated method

---

## Human Factors Study

### 16. Insufficient Human Factors Data

- Labeling and product changes after clinical trials
- No data showing changes resolve previous hazards

To address:
- Provide Human Factors validation study (≥15 representative US users per group)  
- Alternatively, show effectiveness of certification program

Refer to:
- [FDA Medical Device Human Factors Guidance](http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm094460.htm)  
- [Draft Human Factors Design Guidance](http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm259748.htm)

## Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)

### 17. REMS Requirements

- REMS is necessary to ensure the benefits outweigh serious risks
- Further review will follow your complete response

---

## Facility Inspections

### 18. Manufacturing Facility Deficiencies

- Issues reported during inspection must be resolved prior to approval

---

## Additional Comments (Not Approvability Issues)

### Clinical Pharmacology

#### 19. Exposure-Response Analysis

- Missing analysis relating drug exposure to adverse reactions

Submit:
- Plan describing data, analysis, milestones for exposure-response assessment

#### 20. Dose Exploration

- Conduct trials with lower melphalan dose and extended filtration time to explore efficacy and reduce systemic exposure

---

### Non-Clinical

#### a. Organ Assessment Plan

- Assessments at multiple time points including:
  - Histopathology of organs  
  - Thrombus assessment  
  - Cardiovascular monitoring

#### b. Hematology/Chemistry Parameters

- Report all measured parameters to evaluate filter adsorption selectivity

---

### Manufacturing Clarification
