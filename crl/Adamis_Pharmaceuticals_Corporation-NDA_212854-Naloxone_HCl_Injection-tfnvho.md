## CLINICAL

### Deficiency

You have not provided adequate data to support the safe use of the proposed product ZIMHI (Naloxone HCl Injection, 5 mg/0.5 mL) pre-filled syringe in community settings:

- Users are unable to deploy the needle safety guard reliably in intended use environments.  
- Risk of needlestick injuries may lead to transmission of bloodborne pathogens.  
- Laypersons, unfamiliar with the product, may misoperate the device.  

### Required Actions

- Modify your device to include an automatically deploying needle safety element.  
- Submit an updated comprehensive use-related risk analysis (URRA), including:
  - Systematic evaluation using task analysis  
  - Potential user errors and clinical consequences  
  - Risk mitigation strategies and validation methods  
- Submit results of a human factors (HF) validation study under simulated use by representative users.  
- Submit HF validation study protocol for Agency feedback (optional; Agency requires up to 60 days for review).

## DEVICE RELIABILITY & FAULT TREE ANALYSIS

You appear to combine data from multiple sources without adequate linkage:

### Issues Identified

1. Unclear connection between Cpk values and stated failure rates  
2. No validation of Cpk assumption based on normality testing  
3. Invalid Cpk analysis due to failure of data normality test  
4. Unvalidated pFMEA references and unsupported process validation  
5. Missing source, applicability, and normality assessments of input data  

### Required Actions

- Provide clearly connected failure rates using logical connectors (AND, OR).  
- Link standard statistical measurements (Cpk) to failure rates.  
- Include validated normality tests for each data set used.  
- Supply evidence of validated assembly processes able to identify failing parts.  
- Identify sources and justify statistical approaches used in analysis.  

### Additional Note

Also consider CRL Deficiency #4 regarding needle safety device integration into Fault Tree Analysis.

## NEEDLE SAFETY DEVICE TESTING

Response in SN0057 contained flaws:

### Identified Weaknesses

- Missing test methods and rationale  
- Missing sample sizes and statistical justification  
- Inadequate analysis of results  
- Use of unrepresentative alpha build components  
- Contradictory aging and sample evaluation statements  

### Required Actions

- Demonstrate device function at worst-case conditions (e.g., expiry, post-shipment)  
- Verify results using adequate sample sizes and statistical analysis (normality for variables)  
- Provide data for the marketed device, not just prototypes
