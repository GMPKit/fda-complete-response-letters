Dear Ms. Wolfe-Kerker:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated March 26, 2020, received March 26, 2020, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Technegas™ Technetium Tc-99m carbon aerosol.

We acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated February 26, 2021, which extended the goal date by three months to June 26, 2021.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

### A. Drug Substance and Drug Product

1. **Characterization and control of the aerosol drug**

   The NDA lacks adequate characterization of:
   - Aerosol composition
   - Batch formula
   - Batch data
   - Stability data
   - Identity
   - Strength
   - Purity
   - Delivered dose
   - Generator yield
   - Generator duty cycle
   - Generator recertification period

   You must:
   - Develop a quality program
   - Validate aerosol production across radioactivity range
   - Propose and validate analytical methods
   - Establish specifications and acceptance criteria
   - Submit results from at least three production runs at min and max radioactivity

2. **Validation of the aerosol drug production and documentation**

   You must:
   - Provide aerosol batch data from validated methods for three registration batches
   - Batches must meet specifications and be produced using U.S.-approved sodium pertechnetate sources:
     - Technelite
     - Ultra-TechneKow
     - Radiogenix
   - Revise regulatory production description per Discipline Review Letter (December 7, 2020)
   - Include volume and strength of solution, percent yield, and remove outdated statements

3. **Analytical methods to characterize the aerosol**

   Develop validated analytical methods for:
   - Particle size distribution
   - Radioactivity
   - Aerosol yield

   Reference:  
   Jérémie Pourchez et al., "Generation and characterization of radiolabeled nanosized carbonaceous aerosols for human inhalation studies", *Journal of Aerosol Science*, 2013, 55, pp.1-11. DOI: 10.1016/j.jaerosci.2012.07.011

4. **Control of a Critical Component (Crucible)**

   - Submit crucible release and stability data  
   - Establish crucible specifications and post-approval protocol

### B. Process

5. **Environmental Controls**

   - Crucible manufacturing suite lacks adequate environmental controls  
   - Establish and monitor controls per 21 CFR Part 211.46

6. **Manufacturing Control Strategy for Crucible**

   - Establish controls across all stages of crucible manufacturing  
   - Validate operating parameters and in-process controls  
   - Ensure raw data generation, storage, and documentation practices meet regulatory standards

7. **Shipping**

   - Address deficiencies noted in ISTA studies submitted on 1/7/2021  
   - Propose corrective actions and packaging design changes  
   - Updated packaging requires new shipping studies

8. **Production**

   - Demonstrate consistent, reliable production of Tc-99m carbon aerosol  
   - Include documented registration batches to meet 21 CFR Part 211.103  
   - Requirements apply under 21 CFR Part 4 with streamlined approach and Part 820

9. **Reliability Assessment**

   - Current assessment (val-003) based only on customer complaint data  
   - Submit protocol, analytical test methods, specifications, acceptance criteria, and final report

10. **Yield**

   - Procedures submitted (frm-0077, mnl-004) do not address ongoing yield monitoring  
   - Include functionality testing and final drug product yield confirmation

### C. Device

11. **Exposure Dose**

   - Provide details and justification of exposure dose calculations  
   - Include explanation of selected values, conversion factors, toxicity thresholds, etc.

### D. Clinical

12. **Risk of Dyspnea and Hypoxia**

   - Only 21% of CYC-009 subjects inhaled Technegas without operator intervention  
   - No upper time limit or instructions for oxygen/room air administration provided  

   Include in complete response:
   a. For each breathing method:
      - Proportion of CYC-009 subjects using the method  
      - Relation to other studies (e.g. lloyd-1994-2.pdf, james-1991c.pdf)  
      - Risk/benefit analysis for biodistribution and adverse effects

   b. Add missing instructions to:
      - Prescriber/device operator labeling  
      - Breathing technique prioritization

13. **Recommended Loading Range in Adults**

   - Justify the sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m injection loading range  
   - Address trade-offs between studied and recommended use  
   - Recommendation: match CMC studies with to-be-marketed loading range

14. **Pediatric Patients (≥6 Years Old)**

   - Justify lung count rate (500–1000 cps) and loading range  
   - Provide total patient range estimates with sources from:
     - Published literature  
     - Post-market experience

   - Recommendation: address full radioactivity range under Product Quality Issue #1
