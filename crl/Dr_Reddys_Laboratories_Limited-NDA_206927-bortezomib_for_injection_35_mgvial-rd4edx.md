## PRODUCT QUALITY

### Original 1 – Intravenous Route of Administration

1. **Batch EH15031 Reconstitution Issues**
   - Shows slower reconstitution time compared to previous registration batches.
   - Possibly related to changes in batch formula and manufacturing process.
   - Only one 1-month accelerated stability data point available, approaching specification limit.
   - Development batches like EH15014 show delayed reconstitution.
   - It may not be possible to bridge the submitted stability data from EH12023, EH12024, and EH13001.

   #### Please provide:
   a) Additional stability data for EH15031 to verify similarity with EH12023, EH12024, and EH13001.  
   b) Additional batch data for products manufactured using the revised formula/process filed (23-Nov-2015).  
   c) Justify changes in reconstitution time seen in recent batches (e.g., EH15031) and compare with **Velcade®**, addressing potential quality and medication error concerns.

2. **Manufacturing Flow Diagram**
   - The current diagram omits lyophilization, capping, and packaging.
   - Submit a revised diagram that includes all steps.

3. **Physico-Chemical Concerns**
   - Concerns over comparability to **Velcade®** in terms of reconstitution time at shelf-life end.
   - Submit a table comparing:
     - Physico-chemical properties of exhibit batch(es) using final proposed process at release and during long-term testing
     - Against the listed drug product

   - Provide justification for any differences regarding usability, bioavailability, and efficacy.

4. **BE Study Reference**
   - Exhibit Batch EH15031 being used in ongoing BE study (14-VIN-648) for multiple myeloma.
   - Submit the clinical study report upon availability to support the biowaiver review for intravenous route.
