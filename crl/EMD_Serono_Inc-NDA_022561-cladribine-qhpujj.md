## Clinical

Although we have concluded that cladribine is effective as a treatment for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), safety concerns associated with its use preclude its approval at this time.

Substantial evidence of cladribineâ€™s effectiveness was provided by the CLARITY study, which was an adequate and well-controlled clinical study demonstrating benefits through effects on relapse rate, disability progression, and imaging markers.

However:

- **Unacceptable Safety Risks:**
  - Disproportionate number of malignancies in cladribine-treated subjects
  - 33 cases of malignancy in cladribine-treated subjects vs. 2 in placebo across studies
  - U.S. trials incidence: 18.3 per 1,000 (cladribine) vs. 0 (placebo)

You must provide an improved understanding of this risk, either through additional analyses or by conducting further studies.

### FDA Notes on Your Responses

- **General population SIR comparisons** are considered inadequate due to epidemiological variability.
- Increased malignancy risk persists after removal of curable cancer (e.g. basal cell carcinoma) cases.
- Lack of documentation on risk factor balance between placebo and cladribine groups.
- Long-term data analysis bias acknowledged, but malignancy signal still troubling.
- PREMIERE registry plan needs further info and clarity on effectiveness in risk mitigation.

### Additional Comments

1. Cladribine causes sustained lymphopenia needing characterization.
2. Clarify post-cycle dosing plans, specifically maximum duration.
3. Additional analyses required:
   - Malignancy risk and hematologic markers in subjects with prior disease-modifying MS drug use
   - Age-stratified malignancy risks (â‰¥40 yrs)
   - Additive lymphocyte suppression risks with other agents

Appendix provides detailed requests for submission with any resubmission.

---

## Product Quality

- The proposed dissolution spec of NLT % dissolved in 15 minutes is **not acceptable**.
- You must revise to reflect actual rapid dissolution rate.

---

## Labeling

Given malignancy concerns, draft labeling not provided. However:

### Please submit revised draft labeling including:

- **A.** Carton and Tablet Holder Labeling (all quantities)  
- **B.** Carton Labeling (all quantities)  
- **C.** Blister Label (all quantities)  
- **D.** Tablet Holder Labeling (all quantities)  
- **E.** Packaging Design (all quantities)  

Updated labeling must include SPL format content per [FDA guidance](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

---

## Safety Update

When responding to deficiencies, submit a complete safety update per **21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b)**, including:

1. Significant safety profile changes  
2. Updated safety data:
   - New data tables  
   - Comparative AE frequency tables vs. original NDA  
   - Indication-specific event tables  
3. Retabulated discontinuations and patterns  
4. Case report forms for subject deaths or AE dropout  
5. Trends in common, less serious AEs  
6. Updated exposure info (subjects, person-time)  
7. Global postmarket safety experience  
8. Current approved foreign labeling (English)  

---

## Other

- You must respond within **1 year** or indicate intent to withdraw (21 CFR 314.65).
- You may request a formal meeting per [FDA meeting guidance](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM153222.pdf).

The drug product **cannot be legally marketed** until written approval is granted.
