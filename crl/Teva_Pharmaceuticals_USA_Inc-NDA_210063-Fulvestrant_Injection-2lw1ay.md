## APPLICATION NUMBER: 210063Orig1s000  
## COMPLETE RESPONSE

**DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES**  
Food and Drug Administration  
Silver Spring, MD 20993  

**NDA 210063**  
Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.  
Attention: Joann Stavole, MS, RAC  
Senior Director, Regulatory Affairs  
Morris Corporate Center III  
400 Interpace Parkway  
Parsippany, NJ 07054  

Dear Ms. Stavole:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated December 28, 2016, received December 28, 2016, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Fulvestrant Injection, 250 mg/5 mL.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated October 23, 2017, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## NONCLINICAL

1. The safety of the proposed level of the medium chain triglycerides (MCT) excipient in the drug product to be administered by intramuscular injection was not adequately justified.  
   - The potential impact of this excipient on local tissue toxicities as it compares to the listed drug was not adequately addressed.  
   - You may not rely on information from the Summary Basis of Approval (SBA) or FDA reviewers’ public summaries to justify a safe level of an excipient.  
   - MCT were not listed as a component of the vehicle or in the Certificate of Analysis in the reports for the rat and rabbit toxicology studies.  
   - Levels and fatty acid composition of the MCT administered to rats and rabbits were not provided.

   **Required Action:**  
   Provide an adequate justification for the safety of the proposed levels of MCT in your drug product administered by intramuscular injection. We recommend that you submit a final report from a GLP nonclinical bridging toxicology study in a single species comparing your Fulvestrant Injection formulation to the listed drug product (Faslodex) at a clinically relevant dose. This study should include assessment of local tissue effects (macro and microscopic) and toxicokinetics following repeated intramuscular injections.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

### Drug Product

2. Provide long-term leachability data including the safety evaluation report of the leachables from the syringe components to cover the shelf life period. Alternatively, you may include the data from accelerated leachable studies.

3. Adopt specification for tensile and elongation of the plunger rod covering the shelf life as a part of quality control.

### Process

4.  
5. We acknowledge that you provided the extractables/leachables study protocol. Provide the study reports with data.

## COMBINATION PRODUCT

### Device

15. The NDA does not include any design requirements and/or specifications for your prefilled syringe.  
    - Essential performance requirements should be included within the NDA. This should include, but is not limited to: expelled volume (accuracy), breakloose force, glide force.

### Additional 510(k) Requirements

b. You may reference a master file or 510(k) for the verification testing; however, for the Agency to review the information within the K951254, you need to submit a letter of authorization (LOA) to review the information within the 510(k) to support the NDA.

c. In addition to performance testing per standards addressing the needle requirements (e.g. ISO 7864, ISO 9626, ISO 23908), the 510(k) should include a clinical use study that mimics actual clinical use by patient substitutes.   
   - The clinical use study helps to:
     - Isolate problems with the device  
     - Optimize the device design  
     - Identify deficiencies in labeling  
     - Evaluate required user training  
   - If the 510(k) does not provide a simulated use study, provide documentation of a clinical use study per FDA guidance document “Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Medical Devices with Sharps Injury Prevention Features,” dated August 9, 2005.  
   - A sample size of 500 with zero failures of the protection feature is recommended.  
   - [FDA Guidance Link](http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm071663.htm)

d. The 510(k) should include a biocompatibility evaluation of the final finished needle component of the pre-filled syringe per FDA guidance, Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1.  
   - Endpoints to be evaluated:  
     - Cytotoxicity  
     - Sensitization  
     - Irritation  
     - Acute systemic toxicity  
     - Hemolysis  
     - Material-mediated pyrogenicity

18. The release specifications submitted under section 3.2.P.5.1 do not include the breakloose and glide force. Update your release specifications to include these.

19. The stability testing does not include testing of essential performance requirements. Provide stability data supporting the proposed shelf-life of the combination product including testing of:
    - Expelled volume (dose accuracy)  
    - Breakloose force  
    - Glide force

20. Provide a risk analysis characterizing the risks to the user or patient during:
    - Normal use  
    - Reasonable foreseeable misuse  
    - System failure states  

   Include:
   - Planned mitigations  
   - Verification of these mitigations  
   - Acceptability of remaining risks  

21. Provide a description of materials including:
   - Material composition (trade name and common name)  
   - Material supplier  
   - Whether the material is drug and/or patient contacting  
   - Any additives, processing agents, colorants, etc.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

These are not approvability issues:

1. You have not submitted a comprehensive risk analysis or justification for not conducting a Human Factors (HF) validation study.

   **Recommendation**:  
   - Conduct a comprehensive use-related risk analysis based on a systematic evaluation of product use steps (task analysis).  
   - Identify errors users might make and associated clinical consequences.  
   - Reference known issues from public data sources.  
   - If similar products exist, perform comparative analyses (labeling comparison, physical comparison).  
   - Based on findings, determine if an HF validation study is needed. If not, submit your analysis and justification.

2. For documentation guidance, refer to:  
   - “Quality System Information for Certain Premarket Application Reviews; Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff (2003)”  
   - [FDA Guidance Document](http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm070897.htm)
