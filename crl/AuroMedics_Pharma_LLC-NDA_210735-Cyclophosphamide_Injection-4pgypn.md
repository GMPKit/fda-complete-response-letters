### COMPLETE RESPONSE  
**AuroMedics Pharma LLC**  
Attention: Vincent P. Andolina  
Vice President, Regulatory Affairs  
279 Princeton-Hightstown Road  
East Windsor, NJ 08520

Dear Mr. Andolina:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated June 28, 2017, received June 28, 2017, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Cyclophosphamide Injection, 500 mg/2.5 mL and 1 g/5 mL.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated July 21, 2018, and April 3, 2019, which constituted a complete response to our April 26, 2018, and January 15, 2019, action letters, respectively.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

During a recent inspection of the drug substance manufacturing facility for this application, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved.

Please list communications submitted to, or held with, the Agency to facilitate resolution of the observed objectionable conditions, or deficiencies, noted at the facility.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Your proposed Prescribing Information (PI) must conform to the content and format regulations found at 21 CFR 201.56(a) and (d) and 201.57.

As you develop your proposed PI, we encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the following websites:

- [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)

Also consult:

- Regulations and related guidance documents
- A sample tool illustrating the format for Highlights and Contents
- The Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) − a checklist of important format items
- FDA’s established pharmacologic class (EPC) text phrases for inclusion in the Highlights Indications and Usage heading

Submit draft labeling that addresses our proposed revisions in the attached labeling. Use the SRPI checklist to correct any formatting errors before resubmission.

Submit updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at [FDA SPL Resources](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

Provide:

- A highlighted or marked-up copy showing all changes
- A clean Word version
- Annotations to support proposed changes

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

Submit revised draft carton and container labeling based on our attached proposed revisions.

## SAFETY UPDATE

Include a safety update as specified in 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b) with your next response. Include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug, regardless of indication or formulation.

The safety update should include:

1. Description of significant changes/findings to the safety profile.
2. Discontinuation/adverse event sections with:
   - New and combined safety data tabulations.
   - Adverse event frequency comparisons (original vs. new).
   - Separate tables for other indications.
3. Retabulation of premature discontinuation reasons.
4. Narrative summaries for deaths/adverse event-related dropouts.
5. Trend analysis on frequency changes in common adverse events.
6. Updated exposure populations.
7. Global status summary and usage estimates.
8. English translations of previously unsubmitted foreign labeling.

---

## OTHER

You must resubmit the application or pursue alternative action under 21 CFR 314.110 within one year of this letter.

A proper **resubmission** must:

- Fully address all deficiencies.
- Be clearly labeled **"RESUBMISSION"** at the top of the cover letter.
- Confirm the submission responds in full to this letter.

Partial responses are not accepted.

You may request a meeting or teleconference to discuss resubmission steps by following FDA's draft guidance:
