## Clinical

1. **Lack of Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness**  
   - NDA does not demonstrate sufficient evidence of effectiveness for the claimed indications.  
   - Benefits do not outweigh risks, including:  
     - 5.4-month improvement in hepatic progression-free survival  
     - 3-month improvement in overall progression-free survival  
     - Detrimental trend in overall survival  
     - 7% incidence of toxic death and serious toxicities (cardiovascular, hepatic, gastrointestinal, bone marrow)  
   - Recommendations:  
     - Conduct an adequate and well-controlled randomized trial(s)  
     - Use overall survival as the primary efficacy outcome  
     - Ensure applicability to U.S. population  

2. **Device Version Variability**  
   - NDA lacks evidence that the "to-be-marketed" device configuration is safe and effective.  
   - Data obtained from other versions is not extrapolatable.  
   - Must use the combination product intended for marketing.  

---

## Clinical Pharmacology

3. **Insufficient Pharmacokinetic Characterization**  
   - Inadequate systemic exposure data for melphalan at proposed dose/route.  
   - Prior findings from Alkeran NDA not applicable.  
   - Action:  
     - Provide pharmacokinetic data using the intended marketed combination product  
     - Include characterization of major metabolites and special populations  

---

## Product Quality (Melblez Constituent Part)

4. **Lack of Adequate Extractables and Leachables Data**  
   - Required safety tests not included.  
   - Resolution requires:  
     - Analytical method description (GC/HPLC)  
     - Validated methods summary as per ICH Q2(R1) for:  
       - Leachables  
       - Simulated in-use stability  
       - Adsorption/interaction testing  

---

## Product Quality (Delcath Hepatic Delivery System Constituent Part)

5. **Inadequate Toxicological Risk Assessment**  
   - No comprehensive risk assessment for all leachables.  
   - 20 targeted chemicals tested; prior testing based on outdated configuration.  
   - Recommendations:  
     - Determine leachable profile with nonpolar simulants (e.g., alcohol)  
     - Validate acceptance criteria following ISO 10993-17:2002 guidance  
     - Characterize filter housing material for Gen 2 cartridge  
     - Conduct biocompatibility testing: cytotoxicity, sensitization, hemolysis  
     - Provide rationale/testing for colorants including:  
       - Name, CAS number  
       - Amount/device  
       - Size range  
       - Purity  
       - Migration capabilities  
       - MSDS  
       - Prior medical use  
       - Toxicity assessment  
     - Specify maximum pre-/post-filter pressures with justifications  
     - Clarify component updates, manufacturers, and regulatory status (510(k))  

---

## Human Factors Study

16. **Insufficient Human Factors Data**  
   - No data showing redesigned system mitigates or avoids new use-related hazards.  
   - 30 identified hazards rated severity level 4–5 (5-point scale).  
   - Action:  
     - Conduct Human Factors validation study with ≥15 representative U.S. users per user group  
     - Or provide credible program evidence before efficacy trial  
     - Study requirements:  
       - Simulate actual clinical use  
       - Emphasize tasks with serious failure risks  
       - Include thorough analysis of failures and system design/labeling/training impacts

## Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)

17. **REMS Required**  
   - Submitted REMS (dated December 3, 2012) includes:  
     - Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU)  
     - Implementation plan  
     - Assessment schedule  
   - REMS needed to mitigate serious risks:  
     - Hepatic failure  
     - Gastrointestinal ulceration/perforation  
     - Hemorrhage  
     - Procedural complications  
   - Further REMS development will continue post-resubmission.  

---

## Facility Inspections

18. **Manufacturing Deficiencies**  
   - Observations noted during inspection of Queensbury, NY, facility.  
   - Satisfactory resolution required prior to marketing approval.  

---

## Additional Comments (Not Approval Issues)

### Clinical Pharmacology

19. **Missing Exposure-Response Analysis**  
   - Lack of data correlating melphalan exposure with adverse events.  
   - Recommendation: Submit exposure-response study plan.  

20. **Dose Optimization Suggestion**  
   - Consider trials with lower doses or longer filtration to better define safety—especially cardiovascular risk.  

---

## Non-Clinical

24. **Unclear Device Manufacturer**  
   - Clarify:  
     - Manufacturer of circuit components  
     - 510(k) regulatory clearance  
     - Remove ambiguous references  

---

## Labeling

Submit updated draft labeling including:

### General Comments

25. **Trailing Zeros**  
   - Eliminate (e.g., change 3.0 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg) to prevent dosing errors.  

### Highlights of Prescribing Information

26. **Dosage and Administration**  
   - Add "for" between drug name and Injection.  

### Full Prescribing Information

27. **USP Naming Policy**  
   - Reflect strength using drug base and salt form.  

28. **Dosage Forms and Strengths (Section 3)**  
   - Describe:
