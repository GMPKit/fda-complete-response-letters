**COMPLETE RESPONSE**  
Bio-Thera Solutions Ltd.  
Attention: Lan Mu, Ph.D., RAC  
Vice President Global Regulatory Affairs  
34 Vanderveer Drive  
Basking Ridge, New Jersey 07920  

Dear Dr. Mu:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) submitted and received on November 27, 2020, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for BAT1706.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated September 30, 2021, October 8, 2021, and October 29, 2021 which were not reviewed by all disciplines for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendments by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

1. Selectivity data from the experiments conducted in normal human serum during the validation of the bioanalytical method to quantitate concentrations of BAT1706 and EU-Avastin did not meet the acceptance criteria. This may suggest interference impacting accurate measurement of BAT1706 and EU-Avastin concentrations. As such, the PK data from Study BAT1706-001-CR could not be used to support biosimilarity or establish a scientific PK bridge for Study BAT1706-003-CR. There is insufficient PK data to conclude equivalence in safety, purity, and potency.

    **Required Action:** Repeat experiments at LLOQ and HQC to establish selectivity of the bioanalytical method for BAT1706 and EU-Avastin.

## MICROBIOLOGY

## PRODUCT QUALITY

### Drug Substance (DS) and Drug Product (DP) Manufacturing and Control Strategy

5. Proprietary data withheld.

> 2 Page(s) have been Withheld in Full as b4 (CCI/TS) immediately following this page

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

7. The proposed labeling is not reviewed pending application adequacy. Review the relevant FDA Labeling Resources and guidance documents including:

- [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

8. The proposed labeling is not reviewed pending application adequacy.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

9. The review of the proposed proprietary name has been stopped due to application deficiencies. Please resubmit upon correction.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

10. Include a safety update with your response. As applicable:

a. Describe significant safety profile changes or findings relevant to biosimilarity.

b. Update data on discontinuations due to adverse events, serious/common adverse events:
   - Present new safety data using original BLA submission format.
   - Tabulate new and original BLA data.
   - Include tables comparing adverse event frequencies.

c. Retabulate premature study discontinuation reasons and describe new patterns or trends.

d. Include case report forms and narrative summaries for:
   - Patients who died during a clinical study
   - Patients who discontinued due to adverse events
   - All serious adverse events

e. Detail changes in the incidence of common but less serious adverse events.

f. Provide updated clinical exposure information (number of subjects, person time).

g. Summarize global safety experience and usage data, including immunogenicity.

h. Provide English translations of foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

### FACILITY INSPECTIONS

11. An inspection of the Bio-Thera Solutions, Ltd. facility at Guangzhou, China (FEI: 3017231337) is required.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

### DS and DP Manufacturing and Control Strategy

16.  
  
17.  
  
18.  

### Analytical Methods

19. Issues were noted in the HILIC method validation. System suitability failures occurred using certain labeling reagent sources, casting doubt on robustness.

    **Required Action:** Provide robustness data to support the HILIC method using different sources of the labeling reagent. Alternatively, revise the analytical method to specify the validated reagent source. Update the BLA accordingly.

---

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

20. Cross-validation during method validation across BAT1706, US-Avastin, and EU-Avastin was not optimal.

    **Required Action:** Conduct precision and accuracy experiments with QC/calibration curves prepared from all three products.

---

## OTHER

You are required to resubmit or take other actions under 21 CFR 601.3(b) within one year of this letter. Failing to do so may result in your application being considered withdrawn under 21 CFR 601.3(c).

A resubmission must:

- Fully address all the deficiencies in this letter
- Be clearly marked as **"RESUBMISSION"** in bold, large font on the cover letter
- Declare that this is a complete response

Partial responses will not be processed nor trigger a new review cycle.

You may schedule a meeting/teleconference as outlined in *Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants* (draft guidance).

The product may not be marketed until written FDA approval is received.

---

## BsUFA II APPLICANT INTERVIEW

The FDA has contracted Eastern Research Group, Inc. (ERG) to assess the BsUFA II Program. Interviews of applicants will occur post-FDA action (approval, complete response, or withdrawal).

ERG will contact you to schedule a voluntary, confidential interview. Responses will be anonymized.

For questions, contact:
