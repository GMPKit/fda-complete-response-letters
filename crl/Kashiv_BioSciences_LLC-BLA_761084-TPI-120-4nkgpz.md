## APPLICATION NUMBER: 761084Orig1s000  
### OTHER ACTION LETTERS

**BLA 761084**  
**COMPLETE RESPONSE**  
Kashiv BioSciences, LLC  
Attention: John Pakulski  
Senior VP, Global Regulatory Affairs  
20 New England Avenue  
Piscataway, NJ 08854

Dear Mr. Pakulski:  

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated and received August 11, 2020, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for TPI-120.  

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## MICROBIOLOGY

1. Information regarding media fill studies is inadequate. Please update Section 3.2.P.3.5 of the BLA with the following:

   a. Summarized results (media fill date, container closure, filled volume, duration, number of units filled/incubated/rejected, positive) from the three initial media fill validation runs and the latest requalification run that was performed to validate the syringe line filling process relevant to the drug product.  
   
   b. Description of the hold periods (date, temperature, duration) simulated in each media fill run.  
   
   c. Description of confirmatory growth promotion test. Include a list of microorganisms used in the test.

2. The bacterial retention study for the sterilizing-grade filter was performed using the drug substance, which is not adequate. Please update BLA section 3.2.P.3.5 with the following:

   a. Protocol and data from the validation studies using three different lots of the sterilizing filter intended for commercial production using the final drug product solution.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

10. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the:

- [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)  
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

Including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) − a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

In addition, we encourage you to review the FDA guidance for industry *Labeling for Biosimilar Products*.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 601.14(b)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at [FDA SP Labeling Info](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

11. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

12. Please refer to correspondence dated December 28, 2020, which addresses the proposed proprietary name. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

13. Following an evaluation of an inspection performed at **Kashiv BioSciences (FEI 3011289655)** manufacturing facility at Chicago, IL, our field investigator observed objectionable conditions.

Satisfactory resolution of the remaining objectionable conditions, and verification by FDA, is required before this application may be approved.

We recommend you contact your manufacturing facility if more information is needed.

Please see the FDA’s [“Resiliency Roadmap for FDA Inspectional Oversight"](https://www.fda.gov/media/148197/download) and COVID-19 guidances:  
[COVID-19 Guidance Documents](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-relatedguidance-documents-industry-fda-staff-and-other-stakeholders)

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update. This should include:

1. Description of any significant safety profile changes and relevance to biosimilarity.  
2. Incorporate new safety data as follows:  

   - Present using original BLA format  
   - Tabulate new data with original BLA data  
   - Include comparative frequency tables for adverse events  

3. Present retabulated reasons for premature study discontinuation.  
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for:  
   - Each patient who died during clinical study  
   - Patients who discontinued due to adverse events  
   - All serious adverse events  

5. Describe new trends in common adverse events.  
6. Provide updated exposure information (e.g. subject counts, person-time).  
7. Worldwide safety experience summary, including immunogenicity and adverse events reported internationally. Include updated usage estimates in other countries.  
8. English translations of all current approved foreign labeling not yet submitted.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

### Manufacture and Control

Content withheld

---

## STABILITY

19. Stability data was not provided for volume of injection testing to support the proposed shelf-life of 24 months. Submit stability data under long-term storage conditions to support 24-month shelf life.

20. In-use stability studies were performed (Report PTL-2260-R). Only one freeze-thaw cycle evaluated for one lot. Clarify:

   - Quality data pre-thaw  
   - Justify allowed number of freeze-thaw cycles  
   - Provide additional stability data or label limitation

### Shipping Validation

21. Real-time shipping validation studies proposed (Report PTL-2376 and PTL-2374). The following are required:

   - Acceptance criteria need to be more specific than “release specifications”  
   - Protocols should list all attributes tested pre-/post-shipment  
   - Justify any omitted stability attributes  
   - Update protocols with narrow acceptance criteria

---

## IMMUNOGENICITY

24. Provide updated immunogenicity data based on additional clinical samples analyzed with recalculated cut-points (Seq. 0018 and Seq. 0033). Provide this data upon resubmission.

---

## MICROBIOLOGY

30. Update BLA Section P.5.6 with justification for the endotoxin specification.

31. The stability protocol includes CCIT only at the 12-month time point. Revise protocol to include CCIT every 12 months until expiry.

---

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to:

- Resubmit  
- Take another action under 21 CFR 601.3(b)  

Failure to act may result in withdrawal of the application under 21 CFR 601.3(c). You may also request an extension.

- Fully address all deficiencies stated  
- Partial responses will not be accepted  

You may request a meeting or teleconference by submitting a request as described in FDA's draft guidance on Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants.

Note: The drug product may not be legally marketed until you receive written approval from FDA.
