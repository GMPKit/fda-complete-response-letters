# CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH  
**APPLICATION NUMBER:** 215092Orig1s000  
**OTHER ACTION LETTERS**

## NDA 215092  
**COMPLETE RESPONSE**  
Santen, Inc.  
Attention: Raul Brena, RAC  
Global Regulatory Affairs Manager  
6401 Hollis Street, Suite 125  
Emeryville, CA 94608  

Dear Mr. Brena,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated November 19, 2020, received November 19, 2020, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), for Omlonti (omidenepag isopropyl ophthalmic solution), 0.002%.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

### 1. Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Deficiencies

The methods to be used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of the drug substance or the drug product do not comply with the current good manufacturing practice regulations in parts 210 and 211. Additionally, the methods and controls are inadequate to preserve the identity, strength, quality, purity, stability, and bioavailability of the product.

During a recent inspection of the manufacturing facility for this application, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved.

Following an evaluation of an inspection performed at the Woodstock Sterile Solutions (FEI 1419377) manufacturing facility, our field investigator observed objectionable conditions and conveyed this information to the facility representative. Satisfactory resolution of these conditions, along with FDA verification, is required before this application may be approved.

We recommend contacting your manufacturing facility for more information.

FDA will continue to monitor the public health situation and travel restrictions. For up-to-date information, refer to FDA guidances related to COVID-19:  
[https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-related-guidance-documents-industry-fda-staff-and-other-stakeholders](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-related-guidance-documents-industry-fda-staff-and-other-stakeholders)

---

### 2. Inadequate Safety Investigations

The investigations required under section 505(b) of the FDCA do not include adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to determine whether the drug is safe under its proposed conditions of use.

Study 1171504 demonstrated significant endothelial cell loss in omidenepag isopropyl ophthalmic solution monotherapy groups, particularly between Weeks 12 and 26. In the absence of a control arm without the drug, the trial suggests potential harm to corneal endothelial cells.

A concurrently controlled, randomized, 12-month clinical study comparing monotherapy dosing of omidenepag isopropyl versus a concurrent control without treatment should be conducted and submitted.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

We encourage reviewing the labeling resources on the Prescription Drug Labeling Resources and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule websites, including:

- Regulations and guidance documents
- Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) checklist

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure conformity with applicable format requirements.

Updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] must be included in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at FDA.gov.

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Refer to correspondence dated October 21, 2021, regarding the proposed proprietary name "Omlonti". This name was conditionally acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the name when responding to the application deficiencies.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

Include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b) with your response to the deficiencies. This update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug, regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

---

## OTHER

Within one year of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions under 21 CFR 314.110. If no action is taken, we may consider your lack of response as a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. An extension request may be submitted.

### Genus Decision

As per the Genus decision (April 16, 2021), products that meet the definition of a “device” under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act must be regulated as devices.

Ophthalmic dispensers (e.g., eye cups, droppers), when packaged with other drugs, are now considered **drug-led combination products**, composed of:

- Drug constituent part that provides the primary mode of action (PMOA)
- Device constituent part (eye cup, dropper, dispenser)

CDER will retain primary jurisdiction over such products, including your application.

### Submission Details

For every submission:

- Indicate that the product is a combination product in field #24 of FDA Form 356h.
- Refer to "Guidance for Industry, Identification of Manufacturing Establishments in Applications Submitted to CBER and CDER, Questions and Answers" (October 2019).
- Include facilities involved in the manufacture of constituent parts and commercial disposition (e.g., kitting, design controls, verification/validation).

### Compliance with CGMPs

Combination products must comply with CGMP requirements applicable to each constituent part:

- **Drug component**: 21 CFR parts 210, 211
- **Device component**: 21 CFR part 820

#### Streamlined Approach (21 CFR part 4):

You may demonstrate compliance via either:

- Drug CGMPs + selected provisions from device QS regulation  
or  
- Device QS regulation + selected provisions from drug CGMPs  

Or you may demonstrate full compliance with both sets of regulations (non-streamlined approach).

For more information, see:  
[Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Combination Products (Jan 2017)](http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126198.htm)

FDA will assess compliance with the device QS regulation during inspection. Ensure your on-site documentation reflects:

- How each applicable regulation has been implemented
- Descriptions of procedures and activities by your firm
- Protocols used for each activity

---

### Facility Concerns

We acknowledge your proposal (August 31, 2021) to withdraw the analytical testing site and commit to a post-approval supplement for a new laboratory.

This proposal is not acceptable. The application requires a facility to perform drug product release and stability testing prior to approval. Propose an alternative facility before withdrawing the current one.

---

## RESUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

A resubmission must fully address all deficiencies listed in this letter and be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large bold font at the top of the cover letter.

- The cover letter should state that you consider this resubmission a complete response.
- Partial responses will not be processed as resubmissions and will not start a new review cycle.

You may meet or teleconference with FDA to discuss next steps. Submit meeting requests according to the draft guidance:  
“Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products”.

---

The drug product may not be legally marketed until you have been notified in writing that the application is approved.

If you have any questions, contact:
