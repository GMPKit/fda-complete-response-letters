## PRODUCT QUALITY

### Audit Completeness and Data Traceability

2. Issues identified with data traceability:
   - Audit did not cover all BLA data.
   - Missing or untraceable HPLC and SDS-PAGE data.

**Required Actions:**
- Provide a table of all reviewed lots and related test data.
- Identify and remove any untraceable data from analyses.

### Sequence Variants

3. Content issues with sequence variants S77-R77 and G101-R101:
   - Lack of explanation regarding the cause and potential impact.

**Required Actions:**
