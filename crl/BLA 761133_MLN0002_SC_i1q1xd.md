## APPLICATION NUMBER: 761133Orig1s000  
### OTHER ACTION LETTERS

**BLA 761133**  
**COMPLETE RESPONSE**  
Takeda Pharmaceuticals, U.S.A., Inc.  
Attention: Mayuresh Gadre  
Senior Manager  
Global Regulatory Affairs Development, GI  
40 Landsdowne Street  
Cambridge, MA 02139  

Dear Mr. Gadre:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated March 7, 2019, received March 7, 2019, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for MLN0002 SC.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

*(2 Page(s) have been Withheld in Full as b4 (CCI/TS))*

---

## HUMAN FACTORS

1. The human factors (HF) validation study results for your Entyvio prefilled pen submitted on March 7, 2019 identified several use errors, close calls, and use difficulties with critical and non-critical tasks. However, you did not implement revisions to the product user interface to address these use-related issues.

2. Upon review of the subjective feedback from study participants and your root cause analyses, we identified several recommendations to revise the user interface, including revisions to device design, device label/labeling, and the Instructions for Use (IFU) to improve prominence, clarity, and understanding of important information.

3. The recommendations (see Section below titled Product Design, Labels, and Labeling) are based on our review of the subjective feedback and root cause analysis of the use-related issues.

4. We recommend that you implement these revisions along with additional mitigations that you determine to be necessary to address these use-related issues and conduct and submit results of another human factors validation study to demonstrate that the mitigations are effective and do not introduce new risks.

---

## B. Prefilled Pen Instructions for Use (IFU)

1. Label each figure (e.g., Figure A, B, C, etc.) and identify which figure is related to the respective task/step to improve understanding and clarity.

2. Revise the figure depicting the back of the arm injection sites to better anatomically capture the appropriate injection sites.

3. Improve emphasis of the “Do not” statements under “Pull the purple cap straight off and throw it away” to minimize the risk of dose omission and disease recurrence.

4. Revise the IFU to further clarify the end of injection cues to minimize the risk of underdose and disease recurrence. Include visual cues (e.g., “clicks”) and explain their significance.

5. Improve emphasis and clarity around checking that the window is filled with purple. Consider including a fourth figure showing lifting the prefilled pen from the injection site to complete the sequence. Increase prominence of the Important Information section. Add statement under the storage section to minimize pediatric exposure risk.

6. Revise the IFU to highlight preparation instructions after removing the product from the refrigerator to minimize injection site pain.

7. Emphasize information on device safety to minimize the risk of immune reaction, infection, or recurrence of disease.

---

## C. Prefilled Pen Device Labeling

1. Label the needle end on the device body to minimize needle stick injury and underdose risk.

---

## D. Prefilled Pen Device Design

1. Revise the cap design (e.g., remove ridges) to minimize needle stick injury and underdose based on errors and feedback.

---

## F. Prefilled Syringe IFU

1. Apply Autoinjector IFU recommendations C.1-2 and C.7-8 to the PFS IFU.

We acknowledge you submitted a HF study results report on December 9, 2019; however, we recommend you consider our recommendations above for the user interface.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

We encourage you to review the labeling review resources:

- [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)  

Your response must include updated labeling content [21 CFR 601.14(b)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

- [FDA SPL Guidelines](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

### A. General

1. Bold the storage statement: “Store refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F)” to increase prominence.

2. Revise expiration date format to YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MMM-DD. Avoid MM/YYYY format.

3. Update “Manufactured by” statement to match Takeda Pharmaceuticals, U.S.A., Inc. as on Form FDA 356h.

### B. Container Label (Prefilled Syringe Label)

1. Provide a label with a linear bar code per 21 CFR 201.25 and 21 CFR 610.67. (Not required for drug samples)

### C. Container Label (Prefilled Pen Label)

1. Include handling statement: “Do not shake”.

2. Provide a linear bar code as above.

### D. Tray Lid Labeling

1. Revise to state “No Preservative” per 21 CFR 610.61(e).

2. Include the handling statement “Do not shake”.

3. Provide a linear bar code.

### E. Carton Labeling

1. Revise to state “No Preservative” per 21 CFR 610.61(e).

2. Include the handling statement “Do not shake”.

3. Revise “Sodium citrate dihydrate” to use lowercase letters, consistent with other ingredients.

4. Update dosage statement to “Dosage: See Prescribing Information”.

---

## MEDICATION GUIDE

Add the following bolded phrase or appropriate alternative to carton and container labels per 21 CFR 208.24(d):

> **"ATTENTION PHARMACIST: Each patient is required to receive the enclosed Medication Guide."**

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

The review of your proposed proprietary name has been terminated due to deficiencies. Please resubmit with your response.

---

## NON-PROPRIETARY NAME

FDA previously determined this BLA is within the scope of naming guidance. However, a suffix will not be designated. The proper name will be **vedolizumab**.

---

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

During a recent inspection, deficiencies were communicated. Satisfactory resolution is required before future approval.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

Include a safety update with your response:

1. Describe any significant safety profile changes or findings.
2. For discontinuations due to AEs, serious AEs, and common AEs, incorporate all new safety data across indications/dosage forms.

---

## CMC DEFICIENCIES

Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) information is deemed inadequate. You should:

- Perform a risk assessment  
- Determine additional CMC data needed (e.g., process validation, comparability, stability)  
- Update relevant Module 3 sections  
- Include a summary table showing changes and justifications  

---

## MICROBIOLOGY

The response to question 5 of sequence 0022 indicates RPT will be used temporarily. Note:

- RPT may not be required if you can show endotoxin-spiked samples are non-pyrogenic.  
- Refer to PDA Technical Report 82 for dosing.  
- Maintain Bacterial Endotoxin Test spec in 3.2.P.5.1 until method is ready.  

---

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Major changes to formulation or device may require bridging clinical pharmacology studies. Consult FDA before resubmission.

---

## OTHER

You must resubmit within one year or take actions under 21 CFR 601.3(b). Lack of response may be considered a withdrawal request under 21 CFR 601.3(c).

A resubmission must:

- Fully address deficiencies  
- Be clearly marked "RESUBMISSION" on the cover letter  

Partial responses will not initiate new review cycles.

The drug product may not be legally marketed until it is approved in writing by FDA.
