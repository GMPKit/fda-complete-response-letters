Morgantown, WV 26505

### Drug Product:
- **Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets for Oral Suspension, 60 mg/30 mg**

We acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated:
- February 6, 2019 – complete response to our October 23, 2014 tentative approval letter.
- July 15, 2022 – complete response to our August 6, 2019 complete response letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form.

---

## Reasons for Non-Approval

### Facility Inspections

1. Following a surveillance inspection of Mylan Laboratories Limited Unit-8 manufacturing facility (FEI # 30002785310, Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh, India), FDA conveyed deficiencies to the facility’s representatives.  
   - Satisfactory resolution of observations is required prior to NDA approval.

### Prescribing Information

2. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.  
   - Review resources:  
     - [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)  
     - [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)  
   - Use the SRPI checklist to ensure Prescribing Information conforms to format regulations.  
   - Response must include updated content of labeling in SPL format as described at:  
     [Structured Product Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

### Carton and Container Labeling

3. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

### Additional Comments (Not Approvability Issues)

4. Based on our review, there appears to be no need to rely on FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for (b)(4), as those for the other listed drugs (Ziagen and Epivir) are adequate.  
   - Future submissions should remove reliance on (b)(4) in Form FDA 356h, cover letter, and annotated labeling.

---

  - Resubmit the application  
  - Take other actions under 21 CFR 314.110

- A resubmission:
  - Must fully address all deficiencies  
  - Should be clearly marked “RESUBMISSION” in bold at the top of the cover letter  
  - Must identify the submission as a complete response

- A partial response will not be processed as a resubmission and does not begin a new review cycle.

- You may request a meeting or teleconference with FDA for approval guidance by submitting a meeting request per draft guidance:
