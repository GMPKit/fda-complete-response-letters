### OTHER ACTION LETTERS

**COMPLETE RESPONSE**  

**Sponsor:** B. Braun Medical, Inc.  
901 Marcon Blvd.  
Allentown, PA 18109  

**Attention:** Cindy Katsempris  
Director, Regulatory Affairs

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received December 13, 2016, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Acetaminophen in the PAB container, 500mg/50mL and 1000mg/100mL.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated October 24, 2019, which constituted a complete response to our March 27, 2019, action letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

1. During a recent inspection of B. Braun Medical Inc. (FEI 2021236), drug product manufacturer for this application, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

2. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the following FDA websites:  
   - [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)  
   - [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)  
   - [Structured Product Labeling (SPL) format instructions](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)  

   If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in SPL format.

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

3. We acknowledge receipt of the revised draft carton and container labeling on October 24, 2019. We reserve our comments on the acceptability of the packaging labels for the next review cycle.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b).

The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.  
2. Incorporate new safety data as follows:  
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.  
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.  
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies.  
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for adverse event frequencies.  
3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation, incorporating drop-outs from newly completed trials. Identify any new trends or patterns.  
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries:  
   - For each patient who died during a clinical trial  
   - For patients who did not complete a trial due to adverse events  
   - For serious adverse events  
5. Describe any changes in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events.  
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials.  
7. Provide a summary of worldwide use and safety experience of the drug.  
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We refer to the following deficiency communicated in our March 27, 2019, complete response letter and March 25, 2019, information request letter:

> “Provide updated letters from Mallinckrodt that clearly indicate a specific date upon which your application can be approved.”

Your October 17, 2019, response stated:

> “Updated letters from Mallinckrodt (titled 'update waiver', 'update consent approval'), clearly indicating a specific date (October 12, 2018) upon which our application can be approved are provided in Module 1.3.5.2.”

We note that legal review of these updated letters is still pending and therefore we have not yet determined whether this issue is resolved.

---

## ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS (Not Approvability Issues)

1. Reporting of leachables compounds at values exceeding the recommended qualification threshold of 5 mcg/day:  
   - Identify all compounds above 5 mcg/day  
   - Submit toxicological risk assessment for any newly identified compound exceeding this threshold  
2. An unknown compound at relative retention time (RRT) requires adequate safety justification:  
   - Identify the compound  
   - Submit a corresponding toxicological risk assessment  

---
