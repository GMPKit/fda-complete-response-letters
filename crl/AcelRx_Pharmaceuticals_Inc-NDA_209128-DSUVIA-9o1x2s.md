Attention: Kimberly Gaumer  
Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received December 12, 2016, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) for DSUVIA (sufentanil sublingual tablet).

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## SAFETY

The safety database, while suitable in number of patients, did not contain a sufficient number of patients dosed at the maximum amount described in the proposed labeling to assess the safety of Dsuvia. This is particularly important as there is a nearly 4-fold increase in the exposure and a more than 2-fold increase in the maximum concentration when Dsuvia is dosed at steady state.

**To address this deficiency:**

- Collect additional data in at least 50 patients with postoperative pain sufficient to evaluate the safety of Dsuvia for a period following the maximum dosing proposed.

---

## HUMAN FACTORS

We have determined that the human factors (HF) validation study data did not demonstrate that the user interface supports safe and effective use. Failures that result in dropped sufentanil tablets pose a risk for accidental exposure, improper dosing, and diversion. We do not find the risk acceptable.

**To address this deficiency:**

- Develop mitigation strategies to address the risk of dropped sufentanil tablets.
- Conduct another HF validation study to demonstrate effectiveness of the recommended mitigation strategies and ensure the changes do not introduce new risks.

**We recommend incorporating the following changes to the user interface:**

### A. Directions for Use (DFU)

1. Revise step 6 into two separate steps:
    - “Step 6: Depress the green Pusher to deliver the tablet to the patient’s sublingual space.”
    - “Step 7: Visually confirm tablet placement in the sublingual space.”
2. Modify mouth diagrams to include labeled anatomical parts for accurate representation and administration guidance.
3. Label each figure (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 2) and reference them in written instructions (e.g., “see Figure 1”).

### B. Pouch Package

1. Replace simplified graphics on the back of the foil pouch with the complete DFU (including revised and labeled graphics), ensuring it cannot be easily detached or discarded.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

Review available resources on:

- PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information
- Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule
- Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI)

Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

[Structured Product Labeling - FDA](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Refer to correspondence dated March 30, 2017, regarding the proprietary name "DSUVIA". This name was found acceptable pending approval.

Please resubmit the proposed name with your response.

---

## RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY REQUIREMENTS

Section 505-1 of the FDCA authorizes FDA to require a REMS if necessary to ensure the benefits of the drug outweigh risks.

We acknowledge receipt of your proposed REMS (dated December 12, 2016), which includes:

- Elements to assure safe use  
- An implementation system  
- A timetable for submission of assessments  

If approved, a REMS will be necessary to address the risk of respiratory depression from accidental exposure.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b).

**Include:**

1. Details of any significant safety profile changes or findings.  
2. Incorporation of new safety data:  
    - Present new data in original format.  
    - Tabulate new data with original data.  
    - Compare frequencies of adverse events.  
    - Provide separate tables for clinical trials in other indications.  
3. Retabulated reasons for premature trial discontinuation.  
4. Case report forms and narrative summaries for:  
    - Each patient who died during clinical trials.  
    - Patients who discontinued due to adverse events.  
    - Serious adverse events.  
5. Description of changes in incidence of common but less serious adverse events.  
6. Updated exposure information (e.g., subject count, person-time).  
7. Summary of worldwide safety experience.  
8. English translations of foreign labeling, if not previously submitted.

---

## CONTAINER LABEL AND CARTON LABELING COMMENTS

Final comments will be provided once the application is otherwise adequate. However, the following are provided for consideration:

### A. Single Dose Applicator Container Label

Per 21 CFR 201.10(i), must include at a minimum:

1. Proprietary name  
2. Established name  
3. Lot or control number  
4. Name of manufacturer, packer, or distributor  

Additionally, recommend including the expiration date.

### B. Pouch Labeling - Front

1. Improve readability by showing "DSUVIA" in uniform color without intervening matter.  
2. If space permits, include:  
    - “Instruct the patient to not chew or swallow the tablet.”  
    - “Instruct the patient to not eat or drink and minimize talking for 10 minutes after receiving the tablet.”

### C. Pouch Labeling - Back

1. Revise introductory statement to “Administration Information”.  
2. Modify graphics to include labeled anatomical parts of the mouth for proper administration.

### D. Carton Labeling

- Improve readability similar to pouch labeling.  
- Present “DSUVIA” in a single color without intervening matter.

## OTHER

Three citizen petitions (FDA-2017-P-1359, FDA-2017-P-4352, FDA-2017-P-5396) are currently under review. This decision is independent of those petitions.

## NEXT STEPS

Within one year of this letter, you must either:

- Resubmit the application  
- Take other actions under 21 CFR 314.110  

If not, we may consider your application withdrawn [21 CFR 314.65]. You may request an extension of time.

**Resubmission Requirements:**

- Address all deficiencies  
- Clearly mark the resubmission with “RESUBMISSION” in large, bold type at the beginning of the cover letter  
- Clearly state it is a complete response  

Partial responses will not be processed as resubmissions.

You may request a meeting or teleconference per the draft FDA Guidance (March 2015):  
[Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors (PDF)](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm437431.pdf)

The drug product may not be legally marketed until written approval is issued.
