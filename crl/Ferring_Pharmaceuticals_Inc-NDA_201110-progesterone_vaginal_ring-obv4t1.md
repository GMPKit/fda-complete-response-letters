Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received on April 30, 2010, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for progesterone vaginal ring.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated:

- February 26, 2016 – complete response to our February 28, 2011, action letter  
- June 27, 2016 – major amendment extending the goal date by 3 months  

We have completed our review and cannot approve this application in its present form. The following deficiencies must be addressed:

---

## DEVICE

1. Insufficient biocompatibility information for permanent contact duration use. Acceptable data provided on irritation. Still required:  
   - Cytotoxicity  
   - Sensitization  
   - Genotoxicity  
   - Sub-acute toxicity  

   **Notes:**  
   - Biocompatibility testing cannot be performed on progesterone-free (placebo) rings only due to possible drug-material interaction.  
   - Apply the following testing paradigm:
     - Perform additional testing using extract dilutions when cytotoxicity is observed.  
     - Conduct a chemical characterization and toxicological risk assessment of the final, finished combination product.  
     - Sensitization testing must comply with CDRH G95-1 guidance, "Use of International Standard ISO 10993-10".

---

## CLINICAL

2. No adequate clinical safety bridge exists between legacy and new formulation. Recommended:

   - Clinical safety study in ART population  
   - Duration: up to 10 weeks post embryo-transfer  
   - Collect data on:
     - AEs such as pain, vaginal bleeding/irritation, infection, serious AEs  
     - Pregnancy-related AEs like miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy  

3. Deficiency from February 28, 2011, still unresolved:  
   - No sufficient evidence of efficacy in women aged 35-42  
   - Recommended:
     - Conduct a randomized, active-controlled clinical trial  
     - Adequately powered for 35-42 age group  
     - Trial details must be agreed upon with the Agency  
     - Alternative: Labeling limitation and postmarketing commitment for trial  

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

4. Labeling comment reserved until application is otherwise adequate.  
   - Refer to PLR and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule websites  
   - Use SRPI checklist

   - Frequency comparison tables  
   - Separate tables for non-proposed indications  
3. Retabulated premature discontinuations

5. Substantial changes in common AEs  
6. Updated exposure information (subjects, person time)  
7. Worldwide experience and updated foreign use estimates  
8. English translations of recent foreign labeling not previously submitted  

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

1. Biocompatibility Testing:
   - 14-day IP study is not acceptable for systemic toxicity  
   - A 28-day IV and/or 90-day IP study is required  
   - Justify 14-day duration  
   - Clarify IP dose-volume calculations (exaggerated exposure?)  
   - Clarify adjustment factors used  
   - Dosing should be based on leachability of marketed product  

---

## OTHER

- Must resubmit or take action within one year (21 CFR 314.110)
