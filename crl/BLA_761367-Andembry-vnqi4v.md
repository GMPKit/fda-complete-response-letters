1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. When assembling the sections describing:
   - Discontinuations due to adverse events
   - Serious adverse events
   - Common adverse events

   Incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from studies/clinical trials using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations combining new and original application data.
   - Include tables that compare adverse event frequencies between original and new data.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

The following items are not approvability issues:

### Microbiology

1. The plunger movement study in section 3.2.P.2.5 was not conducted under worst-case conditions. As noted in the amendment received June 11, 2024, a new plunger movement study will be conducted using 15 syringes with manually manipulated plunger stopper positions to create the largest allowed air bubble. Provide those results to ensure sterility under routine transport conditions.

### Product Quality

2. While product quality data were submitted to support commercial shipping risk assessment, real-time/real-condition drug product shipping validation data were not included.

   - A commitment was made (June 3, 2024) to perform and submit such data in a future annual report.
   - Submitting validation data post-market without FDA-approved protocol is inappropriate.  
   - Therefore, resubmission should include real-time/real-condition shipping validation data.

### Device

3. In the January 29, 2024 information request, FDA requested device performance testing on 3 batches each of:
   - Prefilled syringe (PFS) with needle safety device (NSD)
   - Autoinjector (AI)

   Testing must include:
   - PFS: dose accuracy, peak force, injection force, NSD activation force (to shelf life of 36 months)
   - AI: dose accuracy, injection time, activation force, extended needle length, lockout force (to shelf life of 36 months)

   In the February 5, 2024 response:
   - Two additional drug product batches were placed on stability
   - Data to be provided in an annual report

   **In resubmission**: Provide the additional stability data instead of submitting in an annual report.
