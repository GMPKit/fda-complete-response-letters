### NDA 214439 — Complete Response  
**CMP Development LLC**  
Attention: Ellen Barkley  
Regulatory Affairs Manager  
P.O. Box 147  
8026 US Highway 264A  
Farmville, NC 27828  

Dear Ms. Barkley:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received June 22, 2020, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for **NORLIQVA (amlodipine) Oral Solution 1 mg/mL**.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## Facility Inspections

During a recent inspection of the manufacturing facility for this application, FDA field investigators conveyed deficiencies to facility management. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required prior to approval.

Additionally, a review of records submitted under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act revealed objectionable manufacturing conditions. These issues must be resolved through means such as a preapproval inspection and an adequate facility response.

FDA will notify the facility of the outstanding issues no later than 10 business days from the issuance of this letter. An inspection of the manufacturing facility is also required before approval to verify the facility’s capability to perform the proposed operations.

---

## Proprietary Name

As per correspondence dated January 8, 2021, the proprietary name **NORLIQVA** was found acceptable, pending approval of this application within this review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed name when responding to this letter.

---

## Safety Update

In your response, include a safety update in compliance with 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). Include all clinical and nonclinical data, regardless of indication or dosage.

1. Describe significant safety profile updates.
2. Provide discontinuation, serious, and common adverse event summaries:
    - Newly completed trial data in original format
    - Integrated tabulations (new + original data)
    - Comparative tables for frequency of events
    - Separate tables for alternate indications
3. Re-tabulate premature discontinuations, note new patterns.
4. Submit case report forms for trial deaths or adverse-event dropouts; provide serious adverse event narratives.
5. Identify substantial changes in frequency of common but less severe adverse events.
6. Update clinical exposure metrics (subjects, person-time).
7. Provide worldwide safety summary including international usage estimates.
8. Submit English translations of any outstanding foreign labeling.

## Other

You must take regulatory action under 21 CFR 314.110 within one year of this letter. Failure to do so may be considered a request to withdraw the application per 21 CFR 314.65.

Any resubmission must fully address all cited deficiencies. Include "**RESUBMISSION**" prominently on the cover letter and clearly indicate that it is a complete response to this letter. Partial responses will not initiate a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference to discuss your next steps. Submit such requests in accordance with the guidance titled *Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products*.
