Dear Dr. Hutman:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated August 31, 2021, received August 31, 2021, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for toripalimab-tpzi injection.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated April 25, and April 28, 2022.

You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

1. We have determined that manufacturing control strategy for toripalimab does not align with current industry standards and ICH Q5A guidelines. Specifically, no adventitious virus testing is performed for unprocessed bulks (UPBs) in the manufacturing process to produce toripalimab and other product(s) for non-US market. These processes share common equipment and/or materials with toripalimab manufacturing for the US market.

   ICH guideline Q5A recommends:
   - “Appropriate testing for viruses should be performed at the unprocessed bulk level [...]”
   - “The safety of these products [biotechnology products derived from cell lines] with regard to viral contamination can be reasonably assured only by the application of a virus testing program and assessment of virus removal and inactivation achieved by the manufacturing process [...]”
   - “Testing the product at appropriate steps of production for absence of contaminating infectious viruses,”
   - Manufacturers should develop programs for the ongoing assessment of adventitious viruses in production batches.

   The lack of an adventitious virus testing program for non-US manufacturing processes poses a risk of adventitious virus cross-contamination of toripalimab batches for the US market, as well as the risk of manufacturing facility disruptions that could affect patient supply.

   To address the deficiency, provide the following:

   a. Commitment to implement virus testing for UPB for every batch of all products sharing equipment/materials with toripalimab intended for the US market.
      - Submit change control reports demonstrating implementation.

   b. Address contamination risks from materials and equipment downstream of the UPB testing point:
      - i. Replace high-risk multi-use materials with new materials. Submit qualification/implementation reports.
      - ii. Sterilize shared product-contact equipment using virus-effective methods. Submit documentation of sterilization methods and justification.

   c. Do not distribute toripalimab batches manufactured prior to implementation of viral safety measures.
      - Confirm drug product for US market will be manufactured post-corrective action within the next review cycle.

   d. Submit a comprehensive rationale on how the revised BLA control strategy aligns with ICH Q5A and industry standards.
