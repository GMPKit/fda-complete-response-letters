Dear Sheela Mitta,

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated and received October 11, 2022, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for AVT04.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

Following inspection of Alvotech hf, Reykjavik, Iceland (FEI: 3013702557) listed in this application, FDA conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the:

- [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

These include regulations, guidance documents, and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI). In addition, we encourage you to review the FDA guidance for industry: Labeling for Biosimilar Products.

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

---

## MEDICATION GUIDE

Add the following bolded statement or appropriate alternative to the carton and container labeling per 21 CFR 208.24(d):

> **ATTENTION PHARMACIST: Each patient is required to receive the enclosed Medication Guide.**

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Please refer to correspondence dated December 16, 2022, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, **Selarsdi**. This name was found conditionally acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to all of the application deficiencies that have been identified in this letter.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a Safety Update. The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies of the product under consideration, regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile and their relevance, if any, to whether there may be clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar product and the U.S.-licensed reference product.
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the clinical studies for the proposed indication using the same format as the original BLA submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original BLA data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original BLA with the retabulated frequencies.
3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature study discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed studies. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each subject who died during a clinical study or who did not complete a study because of an adverse event. Also include narrative summaries for serious adverse events.
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original BLA data.
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies (e.g., number of subjects, person-time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this product, including:
   - Adverse events known to be associated with the product
   - Immunogenicity
   - An updated estimate of use for this product marketed in other countries
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

These are not approvability issues.

### PRODUCT QUALITY

In your comparative analytical assessment (CAA), the evaluations of binding to FcγRIIIa 158F and FcγRIIIa 158V were performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We note:

- Binding assay results for US-licensed Stelara show variability:
  - FcγRIIIa 158F: 172% – 260%
  - FcγRIIIa 158V: 153% – 259%
- Binding assay results for EU-Stelara:
  - FcγRIIIa 158F: 171% – 282%
  - FcγRIIIa 158V: 182% – 277%
- Large differences in binding activity between US/EU-Stelara and AVT04.

Please provide:

- Justification for the large variability in assay data,
- Data/information supporting that your methods for FcγRIIIa 158F and FcγRIIIa 158V are fit for intended purpose.

---

### MICROBIAL QUALITY

1. Microbial method qualification requires data from three independent in-process eluate lots. Update the submission with endotoxin and bioburden assay qualification data for in-process eluates with three independent process lots.
2. Determine the effect of hold time on endotoxin detection using endotoxin-spiked samples to ensure AVT04 drug product formulation does not mask detectability. Refer to PDA Technical Report No. 82.
3. Pressure monitoring during sterile filtration must be continuous. Provide data to demonstrate routine adherence to pressure acceptance criteria during full-scale production. Implement continuous in-line pressure monitoring upstream of the sterile filter during routine manufacturing.

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions under 21 CFR 601.3(b). If no action is taken, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 601.3(c).

You may request an extension of time to resubmit.

A resubmission must:

- Fully address all deficiencies in this letter
- Be clearly marked with "**RESUBMISSION**" in bold, large font at the beginning of the cover letter
- Clearly state it is a complete response to the deficiencies

Partial responses will not be processed and will not start a new review cycle.

If you wish to request a meeting or teleconference, submit your request as described in the draft guidance for industry: *Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of BsUFA Products*.

The product may not be legally marketed until you have been notified in writing that this application is approved.
