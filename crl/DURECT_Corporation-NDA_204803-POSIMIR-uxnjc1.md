Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated April 12, 2013, received April 12, 2013, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for POSIMIR (bupivacaine extended-release solution for instillation) 660 mg/5mL (132mg/mL), 13.2%.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated April 25 and 26, May 23, June 6, July 2, August 20, September 3, 10, and 25, October 23, November 6 and 26, and December 6, 20, 30, and 31, 2013, and January 16 and February 3, 2014.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

1. The application does not contain sufficient information to demonstrate that POSIMIR is safe when used in the manner described in the proposed label. Specifically, we have identified the following deficiencies:

   a. There were adverse events related to the shoulder joint and surrounding tissues in subjects who underwent follow-up assessments at 18 months, after their arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery. There were insufficient data due to the limited number of subjects and the lack of an appropriate comparator.

   b. The risk of bruising, hematoma, pruritus, and dehiscence occurred following administration of SABER-containing products substantially more often than with bupivacaine HCl. There were insufficient data to determine whether the risk is greater with SABER-bupivacaine compared to other treatments and across surgical procedures.

   c. There was a marked increased risk of neurologically related adverse events (e.g., dizziness, dysgeusia, headache, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, somnolence) following administration of SABER-containing products compared to bupivacaine HCl. There were insufficient data to determine the full risk and clinical impact.

### Information Needed to Resolve the Deficiency:

Conduct additional studies to adequately characterize the risk profile of SABER-bupivacaine:

- **a. Safety Study (Shoulder Joint and Surrounding Tissues)**  
  - Evaluate adverse reactions post arthroscopic subacromial decompression  
  - Include SABER-bupivacaine and either bupivacaine HCl or a non-SABER placebo (or both)  
  - Randomized, double-blinded  
  - Capture onset and duration of reactions  
  - Must include efficacy data  
  - Sufficient size to detect ≥1% incidence  
  - Solicit input from expert consultants  
  - Discuss study design with the Division prior to implementation

- **b. Safety Study (Skin and Underlying Tissues)**  
  - Evaluate adverse reactions such as hematoma, ecchymosis, dehiscence  
  - Standardize definitions for uniform classification  
  - Assess until complete healing  
  - Include studied surgical procedures with even distribution  
  - Include efficacy data  
  - Randomized, double-blinded  
  - Discuss study design with the Division prior to implementation

- **c. Safety Study (Neurotoxicity)**  
  - Evaluate neurotoxic adverse reactions and their clinical impact  
  - Assess for duration of systemic exposure to benzyl alcohol  
  - Include SABER-bupivacaine and either bupivacaine HCl or a non-SABER placebo (or both)  
  - Randomized, double-blinded  
  - Include subjects from all studied procedures with even distribution  
  - Include efficacy data  
  - Discuss study design with the Division prior to implementation

## LABELING

1. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

   If you revise labeling, your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:  
   [http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When responding to the above deficiencies, include a safety update per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The update must include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.  
2. For discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events:
    - Present new safety data in the original NDA format  
    - Present combined tabulations of new and original data  
    - Provide tables comparing adverse event frequencies between new and original NDA data  
    - For other indications, provide separate tables  
3. Retabulate reasons for premature discontinuation and describe new patterns  
4. Submit case report forms and narrative summaries for:
    - Each patient who died during a trial  
    - Patients who discontinued due to an adverse event  
    - Serious adverse events  
5. Describe any substantial change in the incidence of common but less serious adverse events  
6. Provide updated exposure data (e.g., subject count, person-time)  
7. Include a summary of worldwide safety experience with an updated estimate of global usage  
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted  

---

## OTHER

Within one year of this letter, you must resubmit or take other actions under 21 CFR 314.110. Failure to respond may be considered a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. A resubmission must fully address all deficiencies; a partial response will not initiate a new review cycle.

Under 21 CFR 314.102(d), you may request a meeting or teleconference to discuss steps required for approval. Submit your meeting request per the guidance:  
[Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants (May 2009)](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM153222.pdf)
