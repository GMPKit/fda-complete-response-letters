# CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH  
## APPLICATION NUMBER: 201110Orig1s000  
### COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTERS  

---

## DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES  
Food and Drug Administration  
Silver Spring MD 20993  

---

## NDA 201110 – COMPLETE RESPONSE  
**To:** Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
**Attention:** Giselle Rose, Director, US Regulatory Affairs  
100 Interpace Parkway  
Parsippany, NJ 07054  

### DEVICE  

1. Your to-be-marketed combination drug-device product, progesterone vaginal ring, contacts the skin and mucosal surface for a **permanent contact duration** (use exceeds 30 days). You provided **insufficient biocompatibility information**.  

   To support safety for the proposed contact duration, provide acceptable data on:
   - Cytotoxicity
   - Sensitization
   - Irritation *(already provided and acceptable)*
   - Genotoxicity
   - Sub-acute toxicity

   - Biocompatibility testing **must be conducted on the final product**, not on placebo only, due to potential interaction between the base material and active drug.

   #### Required Testing Paradigm:
   - For inherently cytotoxic products:
     - Perform additional tests using serial dilutions of product extracts to determine threshold where cytotoxicity no longer occurs
   - Conduct chemical characterization and toxicological risk assessment:
     - On extracts from finished product
     - This may serve as an alternative to chronic systemic toxicity and genotoxicity tests
   - Conduct sensitization testing following:
     - CDRH guidance G95-1: "Use of International Standard ISO 10993-10, Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 1: Evaluation and Testing"

---

### CLINICAL  

2. **No clinical safety bridge** between the legacy ring and the marketed product.  
   - Conduct a study in women undergoing ART procedures:
     - Evaluate safety and tolerability over **up to 10 weeks post-embryo transfer**
     - Include data on discontinuations

   Data collection must include:
   - Adverse events (pain, bleeding, irritation, infection)
   - Serious adverse events
   - Pregnancy outcome-related AEs, including miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy

3. Continued deficiency: **insufficient efficacy data in women aged 35–42**  
   - Conduct a **randomized, active-controlled clinical trial**
     - Adequately powered
     - Compare progesterone vaginal ring vs active comparator
   - An alternate path may be:
     - Labeling with limitation of use
     - Postmarketing commitment to run such a trial

---

### PRESCRIBING INFORMATION  

4. Labeling comments are deferred.  
   - Use [SRPI checklist](https://www.fda.gov/media/88845/download) to ensure compliance
   - Any revised labeling must include:
     - Structured product labeling (SPL) format per [FDA SPL Guidance](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

### PROPRIETARY NAME  

5. Proprietary name **MILPROSA** was deemed acceptable pending approval  
   - **Resubmit** the name when responding to deficiencies

---

### SAFETY UPDATE  

Include a safety update per **21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b)**, covering all clinical and nonclinical data, regardless of dose or indication.

Required content for safety update:
1. Significant new findings in safety profile
2. Organize new safety data on:
   - AE-related discontinuations
   - Serious AEs
   - Common AEs  
   Present:
   - New safety data
   - Combined safety data
   - Comparative AE frequency tables
   - Separate AE tables for non-primary indications
3. Retabulated discontinuation reasons
4. Case reports/narratives for:
   - Deaths
   - AE-related discontinuations
   - Serious AEs
5. New trends in common AEs
6. Updated exposure numbers for all trials
7. Summary of global safety experience and usage estimates
8. Translations of current approved foreign labeling (if not yet submitted)

---

### ADDITIONAL COMMENTS  

#### Biocompatibility Testing Requirements:

1. Inadequacy of 14-day IP toxicity study:
   - Conduct **28-day IV** and/or **90-day IP** studies
   - Duration must not exceed **10% of animal lifespan**
   - Justify current duration choice

2. Clarify dosing calculations:
   - Based on **drug (progesterone) potency**, not leachable chemical profile
   - Address:
     - Frequency
     - Route
     - Dosing volume (assess representativeness of exaggerated exposure)
     - Adjustments for body surface area, frequency, strain, etc.

3. Base exposure dosing on **leachability** from final combination product, not the drug alone.

---

### OTHER  

- You must respond within **one year** of the letter date under **21 CFR 314.110**
- Failure to respond may result in withdrawal under **21 CFR 314.65**
- Partial responses will not be processed as resubmissions
- We recommend a meeting or teleconference; request per 2015 Draft FDA Guidance [Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm437431.pdf)

### PRODUCT QUALITY  

1. Particulate contamination observed in all 5 site transfer batches  
   - Investigate and correct root cause  
   - Demonstrate correction via 3 clean production batches

2. Provide test and acceptance criteria for progesterone **particle size distribution**  
   - It is critical to consistent drug release

3. Revise drug product specification:  
   - Under "Description": Add "Free of particulates by visual inspection"  
   - Under "Microbiological Examination": Include criteria for absence of specific microorganisms

4. Inadequate analytical methods:
   - Validate HPLC for impurities/degradation detection
   - Validation for:
     - Accuracy
     - Repeatability
     - Intermediate precision (QL-level spiked samples)
   - Revise RSD criteria for HPLC system suitability

---

### CLINICAL  

As previously noted:
- **Insufficient efficacy data** for women 35–42 years
- Randomized, controlled trial in this age group recommended, agreed upon with FDA prior to start  
- Alternatively, labeling limitation + post-marketing commitment may be acceptable

---

### LABELING  

Comment on labeling is reserved until application is adequate  
- Revised labeling must be in **SPL format** per [FDA SPL requirements](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

### FACILITY INSPECTIONS  

Issues cited at:
- Testing facility: Northvale, NJ  
- Manufacturing facility: Cincinnati, OH  
**Satisfactory resolution required prior to approval.**

---

### SAFETY UPDATE

1. Changes in safety profile
2. AE tabulations
3. Discontinuation reasons and trends
4. Narratives for serious AEs/deaths
5. Trends in common AEs
6. Updated subject exposure data
7. Global usage and experience
8. English labeling translations

---

### MICROBIOLOGY  

1. Temperature discrepancy in method validation for yeast/mold:
   - Revise ARD_RPT-5064 v2.0  
   - Correct to validated incubation temperature

2. Submit results from microbial enumeration:
   - From site transfer and stability batches
