Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated August 31, 2022, received August 31, 2022, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for **Crexont (carbidopa and levodopa) Extended Release Capsules**:

- 35/140 mg  
- 52.5/210 mg  
- 70/280 mg  
- 87.5/350 mg  

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## 1. Scientific Bridge and PK Exposure

- Based on results from the relative bioavailability studies, **IPX203-B16-01**, **IPX203-B16-05**, and **IPX203-B14-02**, an adequate scientific bridge was not established for the carbidopa pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure between IPX203 and Sinemet or Rytary at the highest proposed dosage regimen of Crexont.
- An adequate scientific bridge was established for the safety of levodopa based on PK exposure.
- Carbidopa exposure from Crexont is substantially higher than that from Sinemet or Rytary.
- Therefore, FDA’s safety findings for Sinemet or a cross-reference to Rytary cannot be used to support the safety of carbidopa in Crexont.
- Safety information from clinical trials must support chronic exposure to the higher levels of carbidopa in Crexont.

### Long-Term Safety Database

- The long-term safety database is insufficient to adequately characterize the long-term safety of Crexont for:
  - Parkinson’s disease
  - Post-encephalitic parkinsonism
  - Parkinsonism following carbon monoxide or manganese intoxication

- Per pre-NDA meeting minutes (March 8, 2022), Division expected:
  - A minimum of 100 patients treated for one year
  - At least 50% using the highest dose intended for labeling

- Your NDA submission includes:
  - Data for only 67 patients with 12-month exposure to Crexont at any dose
  - No patients exposed to Crexont at or above the highest proposed dosage for 12 months based on modal doses

### Modal Dose Preference

- Average dose calculations were presented in your pre-NDA communication, but the modal dose is preferred for assessing drug exposure.
- Modal dose = dose taken for the greatest number of days during Phase 3 trials.
- Used in other product reviews, especially with long-term flexible dosing studies such as IPX203-B16-02 and IPX203-B16-03

### Required Actions

In the absence of an adequate scientific bridge:

- Provide long-term safety data from:
  - 100 patients with continuous exposure to Crexont for ≥12 months
  - Substantial proportion at highest intended labeled dose (modal dose based)

**OR**

- Reformulate Crexont to reduce carbidopa exposure to levels comparable to a listed drug supported by relative bioavailability study.  
  - Note: Additional clinical studies may still be required

---

## 2. Thorough QT Study

- Since Sinemet or Rytary cannot be referenced for carbidopa safety, you must:
  - Conduct a thorough QT study per ICH E14 section 1.3
  - Assess potential effects of Crexont on QTc
