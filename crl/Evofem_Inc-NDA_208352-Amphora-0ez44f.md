**COMPLETE RESPONSE**  

Evofem, Inc.  
Attention: John Fair  
Chief Operating Officer  
12400 High Bluff Drive, Suite 600  
San Diego, CA 92130  

Dear Mr. Fair,

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received July 2, 2015, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Amphora (lactic acid 1.76%, citric acid 1%, and potassium bitartrate 0.4%) vaginal gel.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

Based on the marked disparities in pregnancy, discontinuation, loss to follow-up, and adverse event reporting rates between the US and Russian cohorts in the study, we have determined that the Russian data are not generalizable to the US target population and have therefore based our approvability decision solely on the US data.

As a result, and due also to the high proportion of non-evaluable cycles and the high premature discontinuation rate, the study did not provide sufficient cycles (i.e., fewer than the 5,000 cycles we requested) for the analysis of safety and efficacy.

Throughout the course of the review, we have expressed concerns about the analyses you conducted, and indicated that we did not agree with:

- The definition you used for on-treatment pregnancies
- The manner in which you computed "compressed cycles" for analysis after excluding non-evaluable cycles
- Your inclusion of cycles of extremely varying duration (including lengths inconsistent with ovulatory cycles) in your efficacy analysis

We are in agreement with the revised analysis you provided in response to our communication of February 26, 2016 (Table 14.2.41 of your March 7, 2016 submission). Based on the results in the US population in this efficacy analysis, you have not provided sufficient evidence of efficacy for Amphora gel for the prevention of pregnancy, as this analysis failed to meet your prespecified non-inferiority criterion.

### Study Conduct Comments

- We had advised you during review of the protocol that we were concerned that the requirement that the gel be applied no earlier than an hour before intercourse will result in a pregnancy rate that is unlikely to be achieved in actual use, when women are likely to be less rigorous in the timing of application prior to intercourse. We recommended that a range of acceptable dosing times prior to intercourse be specified in the protocol to improve the generalizability of the results. This was not done. Further, your sensitivity analysis of efficacy according to "dosing deviations" did not address our request for efficacy data stratified by the interval between gel application and intercourse.
- The decision to avoid classifying mild genitourinary symptoms that last no more than one hour after product use as adverse events limits the conclusions that can be drawn about expected side effects with use of Amphora gel.

To address these deficiencies, you will need to conduct a new non-inferiority trial to evaluate the pregnancy rate in women using Amphora versus a nonoxynyl-9 gel. The majority of the data should come from the US population and any foreign data submitted should be generalizable to the US population.

The statistical analysis plan should be pre-specified and submitted for review and comment prior to locking the database. Evaluable cycles should include only cycles in which trial subjects are at risk of pregnancy. Ovulatory cycles should be well-defined and cycles that fall outside of the range consistent with ovulatory cycles should be excluded from efficacy analysis.

Particular attention should be paid to obtaining detailed information on:

- Dates of menstrual cycles
- Intercourse and use of study drug
- Alternative methods of contraception

Use of an electronic diary is strongly encouraged to help minimize the amount of missing or possibly unreliable data.

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

Satisfactory resolution of deficiencies identified during facility inspections is required before this application may be approved.

---

## CENTER FOR DEVICES AND RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH

### Device Description

1. The materials of the pre-filled applicator are not consistently stated throughout the submission. Confirm that the pre-filled applicator intended for use with Amphora gel is constructed from approved biocompatible materials.

### Biocompatibility

2. In lieu of biocompatibility testing, you have referenced existing use and testing. However:

   - Differences in material suppliers are noted
   - No biocompatibility testing on the final finished device was provided

   Provide testing results per ISO 10993. Commercial use history may reduce test burden if supported by usage data and complaint/adverse event analysis.

3. Food-contact compliance is not sufficient. Provide ISO 10993 biocompatibility testing for the disposable applicator.

### Bench Testing

4. Testing was submitted for:

   - Force to deliver gel
   - Plunger separation force

   Identify:

   - Minimum force needed for proper and accurate filling
   - Maximum acceptable delivery force

5. Perform compatibility testing with polyisoprene condoms using 40°C preconditioning for 60 minutes per ASTM D7661.

### Stability/Shelf Life

6. Provide test results for:

   - Friction force between barrel and plunger
   - Barrel/plunger separation force across stated shelf life

7. Clarify or complete your stability testing plan.

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

### Clinical

- An in vitro study (Protocol EFM-COOO 1-GMPOO 16.00) evaluated Amphora used with common vaginal products at ~25°C. Please assess the relevance of temperature and justify applicability to in vivo conditions.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

- Labeling review deferred pending adequacy of application
- Refer to:
  - PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information
  - Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule
- Ensure SPL format per [FDA SPL Guidance](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

### A. Container Label (5 gram pre-filled applicators)

1. Revise label to say:

    ```
    Amphora
    (lactic acid, citric acid, and potassium bitartrate)
    Vaginal Gel
    1.76 %/1 %/0.4 %
    ```

2. Add barcode per 21 CFR 201.25(c)(2)

3. Relocate net quantity statement away from "For Vaginal Use Only"

### B. Carton Labeling (5 gram pre-filled applicators)

1. Apply the same revisions as the container label  
2. Add NDC number and verify package code variations  
3. Place net quantity statement in bottom one-third of label  
4. Simplify strength:  
   - "1.00 %" → "1 %"  
   - "0.40 %" → "0.4 %"  
5. Add route of administration to dosage section
