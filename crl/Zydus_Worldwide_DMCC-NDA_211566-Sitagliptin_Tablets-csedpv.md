## Safety Data and Clinical Trial Summaries

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each subject who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

## Tentative Approval

**Zydus Worldwide DMCC**  
c/o Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc.  
Attention: Srinivas Gurram  
VP & Head of RA and QA – North America  
73-B, Route 31 North  
Pennington, NJ 08534

Dear Mr. Gurram,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated October 31, 2020, received November 2, 2020, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for **Sitagliptin Tablets**.

This NDA provides for the use of Sitagliptin Tablets as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended. It is tentatively approved under 21 CFR 314.105 for use as recommended in the agreed-upon enclosed labeling (text for the Prescribing Information, Medication Guide, and carton and container labeling). This determination is based upon information available to the Agency at this time, i.e., information in your application and the status of current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) of the facilities used in the manufacture and testing of the drug product. This determination is subject to change on the basis of any new information that may come to our attention.

> Final approval of your application is subject to expiration of a period of patent protection and/or exclusivity.

A listed drug(s) upon which your application relies is subject to a period of patent protection and your application contains a certification(s) to one or more patents under section 505(b)(2)(A)(iv) stating that the patent(s) is/are invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed ("paragraph IV certification").

Section 505(c)(3)(C) provides that approval of a new drug application with a paragraph IV certification shall be made effective immediately, unless:
- An action is brought for infringement within 45 days of notifying the patent owner/holder,
- If such an action is brought, your application is subject to a 30-month stay of approval unless other conditions are met.

You notified us that you complied with the requirements of section 505(b)(3).

You also notified the Agency that a patent infringement suit has been initiated against you with respect to patent **7326708** in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (Case 1:99-mc-09999-UNA). Therefore, final approval cannot be granted until:

1. One of the following has occurred:
   - Expiration of the 30-month period,
   - A court decision that the patent is invalid or not infringed,
   - The listed patent(s) has/have expired.

2. We are assured there is no new information that would affect whether final approval should be granted.

To obtain final approval of this application, submit an amendment two or six months prior to:
- The expiration of the patent(s) and exclusivity protection, or
- The date you believe that your NDA will be eligible for final approval.

In your cover letter, clearly identify your amendment as **"REQUEST FOR FINAL APPROVAL"** and include:
- The legal/regulatory basis for your request,
- A copy of any relevant court order, settlement, or licensing agreement,
- A safety update,
- Statements regarding any changes (or confirmation of no changes) in labeling, CMC data, REMS, etc.

Until final approval is granted:

> The drug product may not be legally marketed.
