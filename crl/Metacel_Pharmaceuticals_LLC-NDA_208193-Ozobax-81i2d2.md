Attention: Jeff Bryant, Chief Operating Officer

Dear Mr. Bryant,

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated January 9, 2016, received March 11, 2016, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Ozobax (baclofen) oral solution 1 mg/mL.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated January 1, 2018, which constituted a complete response to our January 11, 2017, action letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

It was clearly stated in the January 11, 2017, Complete Response Letter, item #7, that if the identity, assay, or related substance method has to be modified to be fully validated, drug product samples may require retesting. If there are no samples available for retesting, drug product stability studies need to be repeated, since the current data would not be reliable.

Therefore, you should place an additional 2 batches of the drug product on stability, according to ICH Q1A (R2), and submit sufficient long-term stability data to support the proposed shelf life.

---

## NONCLINICAL

No specific nonclinical issues disclosed publicly.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the:

- [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Labeling/ucm093731.htm)  
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

including associated regulations, guidance documents, and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) checklist.

If you revise labeling:

- Use the SRPI checklist to ensure the prescribing information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances.
- Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in Structured Product Labeling (SPL) format as described at:  
  - http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm
- Provide a marked-up copy showing all changes and a clean Microsoft Word version.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Please refer to correspondence dated March 30, 2018, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Ozobax. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle.

Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

### 1. Product Quality

- Provide batch analysis data on the drug product, batch C0412

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to:

- Resubmit, or

- Should be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large, bolded type on the cover letter

- ["Formal Meetings Between FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products"](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM590547)
