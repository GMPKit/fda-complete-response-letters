## CLINICAL

### Benefits

Study 4053-101 demonstrated production of truncated dystrophin, a surrogate marker considered “reasonably likely” to predict clinical benefit.

- 25 evaluable patients  
- Baseline mean dystrophin level: 0.10 ± 0.07% of normal  
- Week 48: mean dystrophin: 1.02 ± 1.03% of normal  
- Mean increase: 0.92 ± 1.01%  
- Similar absolute mean increases (~0.9%) in golodirsen and eteplirsen-treated patients  

**Conclusion:** If an increase of 9 parts per thousand is predictive of clinical benefit, the benefit is likely to be small.

### Functional Data

Six-minute walk data: progressive loss of function in patients, with no correlation to amount of truncated dystrophin production.

### Risks

Two important safety issues:

1. **Serious Infections**  
   - Related to drug delivery via central venous ports  
   - No mention of such infections in the golodirsen NDA, but seen in eteplirsen PADERs and FAERS submissions  

#### Table 1: Eteplirsen’s Postmarketing Reports of Device Infections, Bacteremia, and Sepsis

| FAERS#    | Date   | Medical History                | Preferred Terms          | Narrative                     | Comments         |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| 13122403  | 1/2017 | DMD, respiratory failure, etc. | Septic shock, cardiac arrest | Ventilator-dependence. Death. | Confounded       |
| 13268695  | 2/2017 | DMD, tracheostomy              | Pneumonia, Bacteraemia    | Port removed.                 | Confounded       |
| ...       | ...    | ...                            | ...                       | ...                           | ...              |
| 16084969  | UNK    | Not reported                   | Sepsis                    | Family reported sepsis.       | Insufficient data|

- As of 3/18/2019: ~469 patients exposed to eteplirsen  
- 11 cases of infection = 2.3% frequency  
- Risk estimated to be at least 2.3%  

**Conclusion:** Risk of infections from infusion ports should be considered drug-related.

### Golodirsen Clinical Program

- Ports used in ~30 of 60 patients  
- ~9 had adverse device events (pain, bruising, rash)  
- No serious or severe infections, bacteremia, or sepsis reported  
- Rule of 3: Estimated 95% CI upper limit for serious infection risk ~10%  

**Conclusion:** Risk identified in eteplirsen is also applicable to golodirsen.

### Renal Toxicity

- Renal failure and irreversible damage seen in juvenile animals  
- Golodirsen excreted unchanged in urine  
- Decreased renal function increases exposure → potential self-perpetuating toxicity  
- DMD patients: unreliable serum creatinine levels  
- No current effective renal monitoring method for DMD  

**Conclusion:** Lack of monitorable renal function makes safe use unclear.

---

## Disparate Risk Comparison: Golodirsen vs. Eteplirsen

### Infections

- Eteplirsen approved in 2016 without known infection risk  
- Now: confirmed risks (2.3%) of sepsis and death  
- Risk is applicable to golodirsen due to same delivery method  

### Renal Toxicity

- Golodirsen: significant toxicity in animals  
- No proven monitoring approach  
- Eteplirsen: no similar findings  

### Summary

- 2016 approval of eteplirsen: unverified benefit weighed against no known risk  
- Golodirsen: small unverified benefit weighed against known infection and renal risks  

---

## DECISION

The Commissioner’s September 16, 2016 letter stated:

> “...this unique situation will not set a general precedent for drug approvals under the accelerated approval pathway... each situation must be evaluated on its own merits based on the totality of data and information.”

Golodirsen must be judged on its own merits.

**Conclusion:** Its small potential benefit does not outweigh the known and unmonitorable risks.

---

## Confirming the Clinical Benefit of Small Changes in Dystrophin

- Confirmatory trial for eteplirsen still not initiated after nearly 3 years  
- No definitive data to support clinical benefit of small dystrophin increase  
- Raises concern for both eteplirsen and golodirsen  

---

## PATH FORWARD

- Provide substantial evidence of clinical benefit (e.g., NSAA, 6MWD, etc.)  
- Develop practicable renal monitoring plan  
- Explore administration methods that do not use implanted ports  

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENT

- Continued use of open muscle biopsies is discouraged  
- Recommend use of less invasive needle biopsies for Western blot analyses  

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

(1) Labeling reserved until application is otherwise adequate.
