# BLA 761338/Original 2

U.S. Food and Drug Administration  
Silver Spring, MD 20993  
[www.fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov)

The subject of this correspondence is BLA 761338/Original 2. A separate correspondence was issued for BLA 761338/Original 1.

All future submissions to these BLAs should specify the BLA number and the Original number to which each submission pertains.

We have completed a provisional review of this application, as amended. A final determination under sections 351(i) and 351(k) of the PHS Act that:

- Steqeyma (ustekinumab-stba) injection 45 mg/0.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringe for subcutaneous use would be interchangeable with Stelara (ustekinumab) injection 45 mg/0.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringe for subcutaneous use
- Steqeyma (ustekinumab-stba) injection 90 mg/mL single-dose prefilled syringe for subcutaneous use would be interchangeable with Stelara (ustekinumab) injection 90 mg/mL single-dose prefilled syringe for subcutaneous use
- Steqeyma (ustekinumab-stba) injection 130 mg/26 mL single-dose vial for intravenous use would be interchangeable with Stelara (ustekinumab) injection 130 mg/26 mL single-dose vial for intravenous use

is currently subject to unexpired exclusivity for the first interchangeable biosimilar biological products, and thus may not be made before the exclusivity has expired. See section 351(k)(6) of the PHS Act.

We have not identified any deficiencies that would justify a complete response action at this time; however, we also cannot approve your application because of the unexpired first interchangeable exclusivity. We have therefore provisionally determined that your 351(k) application meets the interchangeability criteria under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.

This provisional determination is based upon information available to the Agency at this time (i.e., information in your application and that the manufacturing of the biological product complies with the standards established in the BLA as well as the requirements in applicable regulations). This determination is subject to change on the basis of any new information that may come to our attention.

To obtain approval of this application, submit an amendment no more than six months prior to the date you believe that your application will be eligible for approval.

In your cover letter, clearly identify your amendment as **“REQUEST FOR APPROVAL”**. This amendment should:

- Provide the legal/regulatory basis for your request for approval
- Include a copy of any relevant supporting documentation, as appropriate
- Include a safety update
- Identify changes, if any, in the application, such as:
  - Updated labeling
  - Chemistry, manufacturing, and controls data
  - Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)
- If there are no changes, clearly state so.

# Carton and Container Labeling

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

---

# Proprietary Name

Please refer to correspondence dated September 29, 2023, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Steqeyma. This name was found conditionally acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to all of the application deficiencies identified in this letter.

---

# Safety Update

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update. The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile and their relevance, if any, to whether there may be clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar product and the US-licensed reference product.
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the clinical studies for the proposed indication using the same format as the original BLA submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original BLA data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original BLA with the retabulated frequencies described above.

# Product Quality

## Drug Substance

[Redacted]

## Drug Product

1. As indicated in the proposed labeling, individual pre-filled syringes or vials may be stored at room temperature up to 30°C for a maximum single period of up to [Redacted] days in the carton. You provided the stability data under the accelerated 2 condition using representative DP lots to support the labeled in-use storage for CT-P43 at room temperature prior to administration or dilution.

   However, it appears end of shelf-life samples were not tested for in-use stability data under accelerated 2 condition. To ensure the in-use room temperature stability of the:
   - 130 mg/36 mL (5 mg/mL) single-dose vial
   - 45 mg/0.5 mL PFS
   - 90 mg/mL PFS CT-P43 drug products

   Provide additional stability testing under the accelerated 2 condition using end of the shelf-life DP samples.

   In addition, to further support the in-use dilution stability of the 130 mg/26 mL single-dose vial CT-P43 drug product and per ICH Q1A(R2), provide additional in-use stability testing of end-of-shelf-life DP vial samples after the maximum [Redacted] days room temperature storage.

2. We note that you only provided in-use compatibility study with [Redacted] IV bag. If you intend for the product to be used with other common bags such as [Redacted] or [Redacted], we recommend studies to support those.

3. The information for some responses in Section 1.11.1 in SN 0027 received on May 13, 2024, was incomplete and/or inaccurate. For example:
   - Response to information request 4 was not submitted
   - Response to information request 2 was submitted twice in Quality Information Amendment 2 and 4

   Revise the quality information amendment to provide accurate and complete responses to the quality information request dated May 3, 2024, in your BLA re-submission.

# Other

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions under 21 CFR 601.3(b). If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 601.3(c). You may also request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter.

A partial response to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your meeting request as described in the draft guidance for industry _Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of BsUFA Products._

The product may not be legally marketed until you have been notified in writing that this application is approved.

If you have any questions, contact:
