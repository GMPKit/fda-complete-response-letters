## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

During a recent inspection of the manufacturing facility for this BLA, our field investigators conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the:

Including regulations, related guidance documents, and the "Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI)" checklist.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure Prescribing Information conforms to formatting items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated Content of Labeling [21 CFR 601.14(b)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update. The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile and their relevance, if any, to whether there may be clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar product and the U.S.-licensed reference product.
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the clinical studies for the proposed indication using the same format as the original BLA submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original BLA data.

---

## RESUBMISSION

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in the letter.

A partial response will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.
