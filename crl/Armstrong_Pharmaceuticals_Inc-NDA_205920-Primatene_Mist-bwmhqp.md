# COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER – NDA 205920

## Clinical

Although significant improvements were made to the user interface, the results from the consumer studies do not support the proposed over-the-counter (OTC) use of epinephrine hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) inhalation aerosol for intermittent asthma. Specific findings include:

- The human factors (HF) study (G3) failed to demonstrate that the user interface supports safe and effective OTC use.
- Approximately 30% of participants failed at least one of the three primary tasks:
  - Task 1: Initial priming of the inhaler – 13%
  - Task 2: Cleaning of the inhaler – 12%
  - Task 3: Routine use (re-priming) – 13%

These failures are critical as they may lead to under- or supra-therapeutic dosing.

### Information Needed to Address Deficiency

- Develop an alternative inhalation device or optimize labeling for the current device.
- Changes to labeling may include:
  1. Increasing contrast of embossed instructions on the mouthpiece
  2. Aligning language across actuator, Drug Facts Labeling (DFL), and Consumer Information Leaflet (CIL)
  3. Adding pictograms for key steps

- Re-evaluate task failures and implement risk mitigation strategies.
- Conduct another HF validation study with:
  - At least 15 participants per user group
  - Inclusion of users with low literacy, adolescents, asthma sufferers, and those with previous inhaler experience
  - No moderator prompting

- Submit HF validation study protocol for review.
- A community-based actual use study is also recommended.

#### Disassembly Issue

- In Study G3, 3.4% of participants found the canister not secured in the actuator.
- Provide data in the HF validation study on:
  - Devices disassembled at opening
  - Participants able to reassemble
  - Time-to-reassemble per subject

- Submit requested information in eCTD section 5.3.5.4 – Other Study Reports

## Additional Comments

### Carton and Container Labeling

#### Outer Carton (Outside Drug Facts)

1. Lot number and expiration date must be visible per 21 CFR 201.17 and 201.18.
2. Revise Statement of Identity:
   - Use bold, white font on dark brown background:
     ```
     Epinephrine Inhalation Aerosol  
     0.125 mg per spray  
     Bronchodilator
     ```
3. Revise the “Shake Spray into the air before each inhalation” statement to:
   ```
   Suspension: Shake  
   Spray into air before  
   each inhalation
   ```

#### Outer Carton Drug Facts Labeling (DFL)

1. Include barlines and hairlines as required by 21 CFR 201.66(d)(8).
2. Provide complete Drug Facts font specifications. See 21 CFR 201.66(d).
3. Under asthma alert:
   - Remove bullet in:  
     "These may be signs that your asthma is getting worse."
   - Add a period per 21 CFR 341.76(c)(6)(F).

4. Under Directions, include instructions for washing the mouthpiece.

#### Immediate Container Label

1. Revise statement of identity:
   ```
   Epinephrine Inhalation Aerosol  
   0.125 mg per spray  
   Bronchodilator
   ```

2. In Active Ingredient section:
   - Revise to: "in each spray."

3. Under Directions and Warnings, include necessary statements.

#### Consumer Information Insert

- Revisions needed under section C.

  - Clogging
  - Dose indicator user errors

- Behavioral study did not:
  - Assess understanding of priming and cleaning
  - Include users with low literacy
  - Adequately evaluate cleaning demonstration

- Label comprehension study revealed user misunderstandings.

### Information Needed

1. Revise labeling and test via label comprehension study.
2. Conduct human factors study with actual product (not dummy).
   - Include low literacy population
   - Include sink for cleaning demonstration
   - No prompting
3. Conduct a randomized, actual use study to quantify complaints and errors.

### Potential Product Modifications
