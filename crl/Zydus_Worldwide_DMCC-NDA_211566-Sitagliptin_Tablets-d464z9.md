Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated October 31, 2020, received November 2, 2020, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act for Sitagliptin Tablets.

This NDA provides for the use of Sitagliptin Tablets as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

We have completed our review and determined that:

- The application is **tentatively approved** under 21 CFR 314.105 for use as recommended in the enclosed labeling.
- This determination is based on information currently available and is subject to change based on new information.
- Final approval is dependent on the expiration of patent protection and/or exclusivity.

Your application includes a **paragraph IV certification** stating that one or more patents are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of this drug.

A patent infringement suit has been filed against you regarding patent 7326708 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (Case 1:99-mc-09999-UNA).

Therefore, final approval cannot be granted until:

1. One of the following occurs:
   - Expiration of the 30-month stay period
   - A court decision stating the patent is invalid or not infringed
   - Expiration of the listed patent

2. The Agency is assured there is no new information affecting the decision

**To obtain final approval:**

Submit an amendment two or six months prior to either:
- Expiration of the patent/exclusivity
- Date the NDA is expected to be eligible for final approval

Clearly label the amendment as **"REQUEST FOR FINAL APPROVAL"** and include:

- Legal/regulatory basis for the request
- Court order or settlement/license agreement (if applicable)
- Safety update and description of any changes (or a statement that there are none)

Changes may affect review timelines.

Until a final approval letter is issued, this NDA is not approved, and the drug may not be marketed.
