## COMPLETE RESPONSE

**To:**  
Genentech, Incorporated  
Attention: Sabina Zimmerman, PhD  
US Regulatory Lead  
1 DNA Way  
South San Francisco, CA 94080  

Dear Dr. Zimmerman,  

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received January 23, 2020, and your amendments submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for XOFLUZA (baloxavir marboxil) for oral suspension.

We also refer to your supplemental new drug applications (sNDAs) dated and received January 23, 2020, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for XOFLUZA (baloxavir marboxil) 20 mg and 40 mg tablets.

### The aforementioned applications provide for:

- **NDA 214410/Original 2**  
  XOFLUZA (baloxavir marboxil) oral suspension for treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients 12 months to less than 12 years of age.

- **NDA 210854/S-05**  
  XOFLUZA (baloxavir marboxil) tablets for treatment of influenza in pediatric patients 12 months to less than 12 years of age.

- **NDA 210854/S-09**  
  XOFLUZA (baloxavir marboxil) tablets for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients 12 months to less than 12 years of age.

We have completed our review of these applications, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve these applications in their present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## CLINICAL and CLINICAL VIROLOGY

While the frequency of treatment-emergent resistance in adults and adolescents has ranged between approximately 3% and 11% in clinical trials, resistance in subjects less than 12 years of age has been consistently observed at approximately 22% or more, with higher frequencies in type A and A/H3N2 subsets.

Additional preliminary top-line data from Trial T0835 indicate:

- Resistance frequency up to 44% overall
- Resistance frequency up to 75% in A/H3N2 virus in pediatric patients less than 12 years

Treatment-emergent resistance is associated with:

- Virus rebound
- Prolonged shedding
- Potentially prolonged contagiousness

The Division concluded that the substantially elevated risk of resistance in children less than 12 years old necessitates further data to assess:

- Risk of transmission of resistant virus to household or community contacts
- Potential spread of baloxavir resistance

Sporadic cases of transmitted baloxavir resistance have been reported, but there is currently no evidence of widespread resistance. Nonetheless, resistance risk may increase with pediatric use.

### To Address These Concerns:

The Applicant should submit:

- Data from Trial MV40618:  
  *"A Phase IIIb, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Clinical Efficacy Study of Baloxavir Marboxil for the Reduction of Direct Transmission of Influenza from Otherwise Healthy Patients to Household Contacts"*

- Complete clinical study report and datasets from Study T0835 for full resistance evaluation

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

1. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.
2. Review labeling resources at:
   - [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)
   - [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)

> Use the SRPI checklist to ensure conformity with prescribing information formatting guidelines.

3. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:  
   - [Structured Product Labeling (SPL)](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

## SAFETY UPDATE

When responding to deficiencies, include a safety update per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). This should include all nonclinical and clinical trial data, regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

### Safety Update Must Include:

1. Detailed description of significant safety changes or findings
2. Incorporation of new safety data, including:
   - Presentation in same format as original submission
   - Tabulations combining original and new data
   - Tables comparing adverse events frequency across data sets
   - Separate tables for other indications

3. Retabulation of premature discontinuation reasons, reflecting new drop-outs
4. Case report forms and narrative summaries of:
   - All deaths during trials
   - Patients discontinued due to adverse events
   - Serious adverse events

5. Description of any substantial changes in incidence of common, less serious adverse events
6. Updated exposure information (e.g., subject count, person-time)
7. Summary of worldwide safety experience, including use estimates from other countries
8. English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted

## OTHER

Within one year of this letter’s date, you are required to:

- Resubmit or take other actions under 21 CFR 314.110  
- Absence of response may be considered a request to withdraw under 21 CFR 314.65  
- You may request an extension

A resubmission must:

- Fully address all deficiencies in this letter
- Be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large, bold font
- Clearly state it is a complete response  
- Note: Partial responses will not initiate a new review cycle

You may request a meeting or teleconference to discuss required steps for approval. Submit requests per the draft guidance:  
**"Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products"**
