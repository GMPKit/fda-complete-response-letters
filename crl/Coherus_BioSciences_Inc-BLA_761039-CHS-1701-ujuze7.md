Please refer to your Biologics License Application (BLA) dated August 9, 2016, received August 9, 2016, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act for CHS-1701.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## IMMUNOGENICITY

1. In Amendment 41 (received March 21, 2017), for treatment emergent persistent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) with a titer > 2, you report an ADA incidence of 9.8% in the CHS-1701 arm and an incidence of 5.0% in the US-licensed Neulasta arm. FDA identified an additional subject as positive in the US-licensed Neulasta arm, which makes the ADA incidence 5.8%. Coherus conducted statistical analysis of ADA incidence yielding a 1-sided upper exact limit of 10%, while the FDA performed independent analysis and obtained a 1-sided upper exact limit of 10.97%.

Your observed difference in ADA between groups may not be sufficient to support a demonstration that there are no clinically meaningful differences between CHS-1701 and US-licensed Neulasta. An observed difference at or above the 10% threshold creates residual uncertainty regarding biosimilarity due to baseline immunogenicity rate expectations and study design assumptions.

In addition, consider factors such as:
- Titers  
- Persistence  
- Nature of ADA response (anti-PEG or anti-G-CSF)

**Action Required:** Provide additional information clarifying the source of the ADA rate differences. Depending on the findings, further clinical studies may be needed.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

### 3.2.R.1 Analytical Similarity Assessment

1. You did not evaluate the potency of CHS-1701 and US-licensed Neulasta in the forced degradation study. Provide potency data of samples for both products subjected to forced degradation conditions.  
2. US-licensed Neulasta lot 1054829, used in CHS-1701-04 clinical study, was not included in Tier 1 potency analyses due to material limitations. You stated potency testing “can be submitted to the BLA upon Agency’s request.”

**Action Required:** Provide potency data for US-licensed Neulasta lot 1054829.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

Review the labeling resources available on the following:
- PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information  
- Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule  
- Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) checklist  

If you revise labeling, ensure your response includes updated structured product labeling (SPL) conforming to formatting regulations as described at:

[http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

We reserve comment on the proposed container and carton labels until the application is otherwise adequate.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Refer to correspondence dated October 12, 2016, which addressed the proposed proprietary name "Udenyca." It was found **acceptable pending approval**. Resubmit the proposed proprietary name in your response.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When responding to the deficiencies:

1. Describe any significant safety profile changes and their relevance to biosimilarity.  
2. In describing adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:  
   - Present new data from clinical studies in the same format as the original BLA.  
   - Provide tabulations combining new and original BLA data.  
   - Include tables comparing adverse event frequencies from the original and updated data.  
3. Present a retabulation of reasons for premature study discontinuations by combining drop-outs from new studies.  
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for:
   - Each patient who died  
   - Any patient who discontinued due to an adverse event  
   - Serious adverse events  
5. Describe any indications of changed incidence in common but less serious adverse events.  
6. Provide updated exposure data (e.g., subject count, person-time).  
7. Provide a worldwide safety summary, including adverse events and immunogenicity.  
8. Submit English translations of current foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

The following are not approvability issues but need to be addressed:

1. Module 3 is not well prepared. Often, data is referenced without adequate summary or conclusion. Submitting extensive reports without interpretation hindered review. Reports on process characterization and in-process controls lacked clarity.  
   - Address inconsistencies, missing data, and typographical errors in the BLA.

## OTHER

On May 3, 2017, Apotex Inc. and Apobiologix submitted a citizen petition to FDA (Docket No. FDA-2017-P-2803) related to 351(k) applications referencing Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). Comments in this letter reflect current thinking and are not the Agency’s final decision on this petition.

## NEXT STEPS

You are required to resubmit the application or take action under 21 CFR 601.3(b) within one year of this letter. If no action is taken, we may treat your inaction as a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 601.3(c). You may request a time extension to resubmit.

A resubmission must:
- Fully address all deficiencies listed  
- Be clearly marked **"RESUBMISSION"** in large, bold type in the cover letter  
- Clearly state the resubmission is a complete response

> Partial responses will not be processed as a resubmission or start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss next steps prior to approval. To request a meeting, refer to the FDA Guidance for Industry:  
["Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Sponsors or Applicants," November 2015](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidances/ucm345649.pdf)
