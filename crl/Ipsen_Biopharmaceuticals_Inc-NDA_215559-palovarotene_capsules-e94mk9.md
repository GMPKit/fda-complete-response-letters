Dear Mr. Sansone,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received April 29, 2022, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for palovarotene capsules.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

### Major Review Issues That Remain Unresolved Include:

1. Appropriateness of reliance on post-hoc analyses to support efficacy.
2. Acceptability of the external control group (the Natural History Study, NHS) for evaluation of efficacy.
3. Uncertain implications of the observed negative new HO volume data.
4. Lack of demonstration of efficacy of flare-up-only dosing in phase 2 studies; inconsistency in efficacy between phase 2 and phase 3 data.
5. Imbalance in flare-ups between palovarotene-treated and non-treated patients.
6. Unclear plan for demonstration of substantial evidence of effectiveness.

---

## Recommended Additional Data and Analyses

### 1. New HO Classification
- Data on number and type of new HO (new/enlarged/both).

### 2. Annualized New HO Summary
- For ‘Pre-pause,’ ‘Interruption,’ and ‘Re-start’ periods in Studies 301 and 202B/C.

### 3. Comparative Analyses

#### a. Analysis Populations:
- Study 202 B/C vs NHS  
- Study 301 + 202 B/C pooled vs NHS  
- Study 301 + 202 B/C (as active arms) vs NHS

#### b. Analysis Methods:
- Generalized estimating equation  
- Wilcoxon rank sum test (if applicable)

#### c. Matching and Weighting:
- None  
- Propensity score matching:
  - Match exactly on sex and potentially age.
  - Use nearest neighbor, optimal matching.
  - Assess and interpret covariate balance changes.

#### d. Covariates:
- Baseline age, sex, total HO  
- Including CAJIS, time since last flare-up

#### e. Annualized HO Calculations:
- Using final available observation  
- 12-, 24-, and 36-month visit window data

### 4. Within-Subject Analyses
- Analysis involving NHS subjects transferred to Study 202B/C and/or Study 301.
- Plot average HO change vs month by study.

### 5. Graphical Depictions
- Average change in HO volume by visit month for 202 B/C subjects with 301-like dosing/enrollment.
- Grouped by enrollment source: newly into 202C, from NHS, or from Study 202B.

### 6. CT Data Comparison
- HO volume and date comparisons for NHS→202 subjects.
- Regression analysis on baseline volume relationships.

### 7. Cross-Study Differences
- Explore reasons for different WBCT results across Study 202B/C and Study 301.
- Consider age, sex, disease severity, flare-up history.

### 8. Flare-Up and HO Relationship
- Analyze flare-up incidence/rate in relation to HO formation.
- Assess dosing impact on HO development.

### 9. Population Summary Table

Table: Change from baseline at Month 12 in volume of new whole body HO (mm³) by flare-up location

| Statistics | All subjects | No flare-ups | ≥1 flare-up cycle | 1 cycle | 2 cycles | 3 cycles | 4 cycles | ≥5 cycles |
|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------------|---------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| N          |              |              |                    |         |          |          |          |           |
| Mean (SD)  |              |              |                    |         |          |          |          |           |
| CI         |              |              |                    |         |          |          |          |           |

(Add details per fracture site)

### 10. Imaging Consistency
- Clarify whether WBCT images from 202 B/C were blinded and reviewed similarly to 301/NHS and under the same charter.

### 11. Self-Selection Bias

#### a. Model:
- Use marginal structural model  
- Include age, sex stratification, exposure, WBCT HO volume

#### b. If infeasible:
- Propose sensitivity analyses to address selection bias

### 12. Dataset Construction
- Create Study 202 B/C dataset compatible with ADHOV4.
- Include:
  - All WBCT data
  - Relevant baseline variables (e.g., walking ability, disability status)
  - Flag for NHS transfers into 202 B/C

### 13. Program Documentation
- Submit guidance documentation on datasets and traceable subject IDs for cross-study tracking.
