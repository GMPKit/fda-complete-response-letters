## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiency, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b).  
The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

### The safety update should include:

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each subject who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this product. Include an updated estimate of use for product marketed in other countries.

8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## NDA 022231 - COMPLETE RESPONSE

### Applicant:  
Mallinckrodt Hospital Products IP Limited  
Attention: James Burgess  
Associate Director, Regulatory Affairs  
1425 US Route 206  
Bedminster, NJ 07921

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) originally submitted May 1, 2009, received May 4, 2009, and your amendments submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for **Terlivaz (terlipressin) 1 mg injection**.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form.

### CLINICAL

In 2009 we stated:

> “You will need to conduct at least one additional adequate and well-controlled study to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of intravenous terlipressin for the treatment of HRS type I.”

You submitted CONFIRM, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The prespecified primary endpoint was verified HRS reversal, defined as:

- 2 consecutive serum creatinine values ≤1.5 mg/dL at least 2 hours apart while on treatment,
- By Day 14 or discharge,
- Patients needed to be alive without renal replacement therapy for ≥10 days after achieving verified HRS reversal.

**Result:** CONFIRM met its primary endpoint.

**Concern:** Higher rate of serious adverse events of respiratory failure:
- Terlipressin: 14%
- Placebo: 5%

**Conclusion:** Conduct an adequate and well-controlled study that demonstrates an acceptable risk-benefit profile.  
FDA recommends that the primary endpoint and analysis plan be discussed and agreed upon in advance. A two-sided p-value of 0.1 may be appropriate.

## NDA 022231 - COMPLETE RESPONSE

### Applicant:  
Orphan Therapeutics, LLC  
Attention: Candice Teuber, PharmD  
3 Werner Drive, Suite 210  
Lebanon, NJ 08833

### CLINICAL/STATISTICAL

You submitted:

- **OT-0401**: DBPC study in HRS Type I  
- **TAHRS**: Smaller, open-label, cross-over study in HRS Types I and II

**Findings:**

- OT-0401 showed modest serum creatinine reduction but failed pre-specified primary endpoint.
- Post-hoc analysis reached statistical significance but insufficient for single study approval.
- TAHRS failed prespecified endpoint and lacked sustained creatinine effect.
- 14-day safety data insufficient (n=11 in OT-0401, n=9 in TAHRS).
- Serious adverse events increased and occurred earlier in terlipressin arm.

**Consequence:**  
An additional adequate and well-controlled study is needed (p<0.05). We are available to discuss trial design and endpoints.

---

## DRAFT CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

Please revise:

- **Vial Label:** Include drug product composition (excipients and quantities).
- **Carton Label:** Revise statement to:

> "Once reconstituted, store refrigerated (2-8°C) and use within hours. Do not freeze."
