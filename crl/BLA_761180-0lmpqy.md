## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. **Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.**

2. **When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:**
    - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
    - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
    - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
    - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

3. **Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation** by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

4. **Provide case report forms and narrative summaries** for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

5. **Describe any information** that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.
