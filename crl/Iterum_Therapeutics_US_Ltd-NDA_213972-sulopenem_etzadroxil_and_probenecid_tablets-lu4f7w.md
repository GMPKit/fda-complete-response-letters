## OTHER ACTION LETTERS

### NDA 213972  
**COMPLETE RESPONSE**  
**Iterum Therapeutics U.S. Ltd.**  
c/o Iterum Therapeutics Ltd. USA  
Attention: Steven I. Aronin, M.D.  
Senior Vice President and Head of Clinical Development  
20 Research Parkway, Suite A  
Old Saybrook, CT 06475

Dear Dr. Aronin,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated November 25, 2020, received November 25, 2020, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for sulopenem etzadroxil and probenecid tablets, 500 mg/500 mg.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## CLINICAL and STATISTICAL

There is a lack of substantial evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, as defined in 21 CFR ยง314.126, that the drug product will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its proposed labeling (21 CFR ยง314.125(b)(5)).

The clinical data submitted from Study 301 do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness of sulopenem etzadroxil and probenecid tablets for the proposed indication of treatment of adult women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI) caused by designated susceptible microorganisms proven or strongly suspected to be nonsusceptible to a quinolone.

The reasons for reaching this conclusion are as follows:

1. Although statistical significance was demonstrated for the difference in overall response rate by treatment arm in the ciprofloxacin-resistant (mMITT-R) population, the results are not sufficient as a single trial without a second adequate and well-controlled trial.
2. The other trials conducted with sulopenem failed to meet their primary endpoint, and therefore, could not provide evidence of effectiveness. In addition, these negative trials call into question the effectiveness of sulopenem for the treatment of uUTI. In Study 301, significantly inferior results were observed in the overall response rate for sulopenem compared to ciprofloxacin in the ciprofloxacin-susceptible (mMITT-S) population. Significantly inferior results for sulopenem were also observed in the complicated urinary tract infections trial (Study 302) and there was a lack of noninferiority of sulopenem in the complicated intra-abdominal infections trial (Study 303).

To address these deficiencies, we recommend:

- Conducting at least one additional adequate and well-controlled study in uUTI  
- Considering the use of a different active comparator drug that reflects current treatment recommendations  
- Conducting further investigation to determine the optimal sulopenem dosing regimen

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the following websites:

- [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)  
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)  

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at [FDA.gov](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

## CONTAINER LABELS AND CARTON LABELING

### Container Labels and Carton Labeling

- Revise the recommended dosage statement to read:  
  `Recommended Dosage: See prescribing information.`

### Container Labels

- Ensure that a linear barcode is included on the 10- and 30-count bottle labels in accordance with 21 CFR 201.25(c)(2).  
- Orient the barcode vertically.  
- Ensure sufficient white space surrounds the barcode.  
- A linear barcode must also be included on the blister cell, with sufficient white space around it in accordance with 21 CFR 201.25(c)(i).

### Carton Labeling

- Add the linear barcode to the proposed -count unit-dose carton labeling, ensuring sufficient white space for scanner readability.  
- Include both human-readable and machine-readable product identifiers on each carton.  
- Recommend specifying the location of the 2D data matrix barcode near the human-readable identifier.  
- Maintain sufficient white space between linear and 2D matrix barcodes.

When responding to the deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b) with the following:

1. Detailed description of significant changes or findings in the safety profile  
2. New safety data:  
   - Use original submission format  
   - Tabulate new and original data together  
   - Include comparison tables for adverse event frequency  
   - Provide separate tables for other indications  
3. Retabulation of premature trial discontinuation reasons  
4. Case report forms and narrative summaries for:  
   - Deaths  
   - Trial discontinuations due to adverse events  
   - Serious adverse events  
5. Change in incidence of minor adverse events  
6. Updated exposure information (e.g., number of subjects, person-time)  
7. Summary of worldwide safety experience and drug usage abroad  
8. English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

These comments/recommendations are not approvability issues:

- Results of the nonclinical PK/PD studies are inconclusive. Insufficient evidence supports T>MIC as the PK/PD index for sulopenem.  
- Issues include:  
  - Reliance on a single dosing schedule  
  - Varying models in data fitting  
  - Concerns with target determination methodology

**Recommendations:**

- Conduct additional nonclinical PK/PD studies  
- Submit study plans and protocols for FDA review before initiating studies

## OTHER

Within one year of this letter, you must either resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. Failure to respond may be considered a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65.

### Resubmission Guidelines:

- Fully address all deficiencies  
- Clearly mark submission with "RESUBMISSION" in large, bold font at the beginning of the cover letter
