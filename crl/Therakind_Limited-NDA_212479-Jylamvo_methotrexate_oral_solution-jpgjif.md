Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received March 1, 2021, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Jylamvo (methotrexate) oral solution.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

### Facility:

1. During a review of records requested under section 704(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and provided by the manufacturing facility, the FDA noted objectionable conditions. These objectionable conditions will be conveyed to the representative of the facility within 10 business days of this Complete Response Letter. Satisfactory resolution of these objectionable conditions is required (e.g., preapproval inspection and/or adequate facility responses addressing these conditions) before this application may be approved.

   If it is determined that an inspection is needed to approve your application, please note that FDA continues to monitor the public health situation as well as travel restrictions. We are actively working to define an approach for scheduling outstanding inspections, once safe travel may resume and based on public health need and other factors.

   For more information, please see the FDA guidances related to COVID-19. These guidances can be found at:  
   https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-related-guidance-documents-industry-fda-staff-and-other-stakeholders

## LABELING

### Prescribing Information

Refer to FDA regulations and guidance documents, including the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI), a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in Structured Product Labeling (SPL) format as described at:  
http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

10. Submit your November 18, 2021 draft carton and container labeling based on our proposed revisions dated November 12, 2021.

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. When assembling the sections describing:
   - Discontinuations due to adverse events
   - Serious adverse events
   - Common adverse events

   Incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events.

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.  
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. Also provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.  
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.  
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person-time).  
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.  
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. You may also request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial response to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your meeting request as described in the draft guidance for industry _Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products._

The drug product may not be legally marketed until you have been notified in writing that this application is approved.

If you have any questions, call:
