## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the:

- [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)  
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

...including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) – a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at [FDA SPL](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm).

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

---

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

Following surveillance inspection of the manufacturing facility listed in this application, FDA conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of the observations is required before this NDA may be approved.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.
3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each subject who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

1. Conduct clinical studies to demonstrate the comparable bioavailability/bioequivalence and safety of your drug product. In addition, labeling specific to your product may be needed, and your submission may need to include risk mitigation strategies to address the risks for medication error due to inappropriate product substitution.
2. Provide a thorough safety assessment based on a comprehensive literature search to support the safety of the proposed drug product.

Alternatively, consider reformulating the proposed product.

3. Explain the significant difference in Osmolality reported for developmental drug product batch BORP1068 (module 3.2.P.2, Table 50) with that reported at release for NDA exhibit batches 7Q10042A, 7Q10043A, and 7Q10044A. Also, provide stability data which establishes that the values observed at release for the NDA exhibit batches does not change over time.
4. Revise the release and stability specification for Degradation Products to:
   - Report all known and unknown impurities, and degradants observed at or above the method limit of quantitation.
   - Report total impurities as the sum of all observed known and unknown impurities or degradants.
   - This will permit trend analysis for degradants and establish mass balance.
5. Provide updated stability data from the ongoing stability studies on the NDA exhibit batches to justify the proposed criteria in the release specification.
6. During a recent inspection of the manufacturing facility for this application, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved.

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. You may also request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.

A resubmission must:

- Fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter.
- Be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter of the submission.
- Clearly state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter.

A partial response to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your meeting request as described in the draft guidance for industry: **Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products**.

The product may not be legally marketed until you have been notified in writing that this application is approved.
