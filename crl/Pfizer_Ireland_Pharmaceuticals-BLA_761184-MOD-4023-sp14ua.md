## OTHER ACTION LETTERS

### BLA 761184 — COMPLETE RESPONSE

**Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals**  
C/O Pfizer Inc.  
Attention: Gurunandan Mavinkurve, MS, RPh, US Agent  
Director, Global Regulatory Affairs  
235 E. 42nd Street (219/9/81)  
New York, NY 10017  

Dear Mr. Mavinkurve:

Please refer to your biologic license application (BLA) dated and received October 22, 2020, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for MOD-4023 injection.

We acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated September 15, 2021, which extended the goal date by three months.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## Clinical/Immunology

1. In Trial CP-4-006¹, annualized height velocity (AHV) at 12 months was noninferior to Genotropin, although not superior. However, there was a high rate of anti-drug antibody formation (ADA) due to MOD-4023 exposure in clinical studies versus the active comparator (Genotropin):
    - In Trial CP-4-006, 77% of MOD-4023-treated subjects were ADA-positive compared to 16% of Genotropin-treated subjects.
    - 76% of ADA-positive subjects had persistent (greater than 6 months) antibodies in MOD-4023 group versus 5% in the Genotropin group.
    - Five subjects in Trial CP-4-006 developed neutralizing antibodies. One of those subjects had a concerning reduction in AHV from 11.8 cm/year (Month 12) to 3.0 cm/year (Month 18).

There are insufficient follow-up data to determine whether the reduction in AHV in this patient was caused by immunogenicity. We consider attenuation of effectiveness due to immunogenicity to be a potential risk at this time.

Because of the homology in amino acid sequence among MOD-4023, native growth hormone, and other recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) products, there is concern that antibodies cross-reactive to other growth hormone products could develop. If persistent, these could potentially result in non-responsiveness to other hGH replacement therapy.

Given the availability of other hGH replacement therapies that have similar efficacy and that do not carry this risk, MOD-4023 does not appear to address any identifiable unmet need that would justify its approval in light of this uncertainty. We conclude that the benefit–risk profile for MOD-4023 is unfavorable at this time.

**Requested Actions:**

- Provide reassurance that ADA formation caused by MOD-4023 is not expected to impact long-term growth and does not interfere with other hGH formulations.
- Provide data showing ADA (including neutralizing antibodies) meaningfully decreases or resolves with MOD-4023 discontinuation and/or switching to other approved hGH formulations.
- If neutralizing antibodies do not resolve, provide data showing long-term growth is not impacted.
- Provide mitigation strategies to address potential impact of neutralizing antibodies.

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

Inspections of the following facilities are required before this application can be approved:

- Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, Dublin, Ireland (FEI: 3004145594)
- Pfizer Manufacturing Belgium NV (FEI: 1000654629)

Due to U.S. Government and/or Agency-wide travel restrictions, we were unable to complete these inspections during the current review cycle.

You may respond to other deficiencies in this Complete Response letter while travel restrictions remain in effect. However, the application cannot be approved until these inspections are completed and findings assessed.

## SAFETY UPDATE

When responding to the above deficiencies, include a safety update. The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the product, regardless of:

- Indication
- Dosage form
- Dose level

**Include the following:**

1. Detailed description of significant changes or findings in the safety profile.
2. For adverse events:
   - Present new safety data from studies/clinical trials using same format as original submission.
   - Present combined tabulations of new and original application data.
   - Include tables comparing frequencies of adverse events in original vs. retabulated data.
   - For other indications, provide separate adverse event frequency tables.
3. Retabulation of reasons for premature trial discontinuation including new drop-outs. Describe new trends or patterns.
4. Case report forms and narrative summaries for:
   - Each patient who died during a clinical trial
   - Patients who discontinued due to adverse events
   - Serious adverse events
5. Description of changes in incidence of common but less serious adverse events between new and original data.
6. Updated exposure information (e.g., number of subjects, person time).
7. Summary of worldwide safety experience for the product, including updated estimate of use in other countries.
8. English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.
