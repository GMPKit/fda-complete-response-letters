## BLA 761258  
### COMPLETE RESPONSE  
**Akeso Biopharma Co., Ltd.**  
c/o Akesobio, Inc.  
Attention: Liang Liu (U.S. Agent)  
81 Belhaven Avenue  
Daly City, CA 94015  

Dear Liang Liu,

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated July 15, 2021, received July 16, 2021, and your amendments submitted under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for AK105.

We acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated June 14, 2022, which extended the goal date by three months.

We also refer to the general advice letter, issued October 14, 2022, notifying you that the extended PDUFA date of October 16, 2022, would be missed due to travel restrictions preventing the inspection of Akeso Biopharma Co., Ltd.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

1. Given the changing treatment landscape for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), current results of Study AK105-202 in patients with metastatic non-keratinizing NPC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other prior line of therapy treated with penpulimab-kcqx do not provide a meaningful advantage over currently available therapy, as required by 21 CFR 601.41 Subpart E for accelerated approval.

### Potential Path Forward for Clinical Deficiencies

2. You should conduct a multiregional randomized clinical trial comparing penpulimab-kcqx to an acceptable control in patients with metastatic NPC which should utilize progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) endpoints. The trial should enroll an adequate representation of U.S. patients.

---

## CHEMISTRY, MANUFACTURING, AND CONTROLS (CMC)

3. Provide comparative growth data (e.g., growth kinetics, viability, VCD, characteristics of fermentation process, etc.), drug substance (DS) release data, and extended analytical characterization data (e.g., glycan analyses, primary, secondary and higher structure, results for product variants using sufficiently sensitive methods, etc.) from materials produced using the new cell bank(s) to historical at-scale manufacturing experience and clinical experience (where applicable).

4. Reference is made to information provided in the original submission and in response to the Agency’s IRs dated April 12, 2022, and August 18, 2022. The totality of information and data provided is inadequate to support the suitability of the following quality control methods for their intended use:  
   - To resolve these deficiencies, you should optimize and validate the methods for their intended use.  
   - Provide updated method procedures (if applicable).  
   - Include method validation/revalidation results.

5. Reference is made to the information and data provided in the original submission and in response to the Agency’s IR dated September 9, 2021, concerning the penpulimab-kcqx drug product (DP) manufacturing process control strategy. The information provided is insufficient to support the following process control ranges:  
   - Provide additional supporting information and data from appropriate process validation and stability studies.

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

Following the pre-license inspection (PLI) of Akeso Biopharma Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China (FEI 3017057933), the DS and DP manufacturing facility listed in this application, FDA conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility.

FDA has reviewed the responses from the facility, and not all deficiencies have been satisfactorily resolved.

- Satisfactory responses to these deficiencies should be provided by the facility to the email address provided on the Form FDA 483 Inspectional Observations.
- Your complete response should include the date of the facility’s response to the Post-action Letter.
- The resolution of inspection deficiencies will be evaluated upon receipt of the complete response and may require re-inspection of the facility.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update. The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

7. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

8. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:

   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.  
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.  
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies.  
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

9. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

10. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each subject who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. Include narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

11. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

12. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

13. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this product. Include an updated estimate of use for product marketed in other countries.

14. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 601.3(b).

- Clearly state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined

> A partial response will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your meeting request as described in the draft guidance for industry:  
**Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products**
