Northbrook, IL 60062

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## Deficiencies

### 1. Blood Pressure Elevation

Jatenzo causes clinically meaningful increases in blood pressure.

- Daytime average SBP increase of 5.0 mmHg vs. -0.1 mmHg with comparator Topical Axiron  
- 7.2% of subjects required new or increased antihypertensive treatment vs. 1.8% with Topical Axiron

These changes, when administered chronically, increase risk for:

- Myocardial infarction
- Stroke
- Cardiovascular death

#### Information Needed to Resolve Deficiency #1

- Include detailed labeling proposals (e.g., Boxed Warning, Indications, Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions)
- Consider strategies beyond labeling, such as a REMS with elements to assure safe use
- Provide risk mitigation assessment to support favorable benefit/risk profile

### 2. Plasma vs. Serum Testosterone Monitoring

Issue with use of NaF/EDTA tubes vs plain serum tubes; observed differences in T levels due to differing:

- Sample temperatures
- LC-MS/MS methodologies

TU to T ex vivo conversion extent is unknown.

#### Information Needed to Resolve Deficiency #2

- Conduct a comparative study using:
  - Serum (plain tubes)
  - Plasma in NaF/EDTA tubes
  - Non-NaF-containing plasma tubes
- Test at multiple timepoints and temperatures
- Include zero-timepoint plasma assessment
- Conduct cross-reactivity study with immunoassays commonly used for T measurements
- Validate bioanalytical methods across matrices
- Ensure availability of accurate T diagnostic assays at time of NDA approval
- If unable to confirm plasma/NaF/EDTA accuracy, a new Phase 3 trial may be required

### 3. Nonclinical Studies (Fertility & Carcinogenicity)

- Inadequate TU dosing in fertility study
- Lack of expected spermatogenesis effects
- No toxicokinetic data
- Carcinogenicity study failed to determine MTD per ICH S1C(R2) guidance
- Insufficient sample size: 25 males/group is not adequate

#### Information Needed to Resolve Deficiency #3

- Provide fertility dose justification
- Submit new carcinogenicity protocol for FDA review and approval
- Alternatively, submit the NDA under 505(b)(2) using published literature and exclude study results from labeling

---

## Additional Comments

1. Data is insufficient to definitively exclude risk of adrenal insufficiency.  
2. Evaluate drug–drug interaction potential of TU as a perpetrator.

---

## Prescribing Information

- Comments on proposed labeling are reserved.
- Review SRPI checklist to ensure proper format.
- Updated labeling content must be submitted in SPL format.

---

## Carton and Container Labeling

Include the following revisions in submission:

```
Jatenzo (testosterone undecanoate) Capsules, 158 mg, 198 mg, or 237 mg
```

---

## Proprietary Name

- The name "Jatenzo" found acceptable (September 5, 2017), pending application approval.
- Resubmit name with response to deficiencies.

---

## Safety Update Requirements (21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b))

Provide the following:

1. Significant finding changes in safety profile  
2. Safety data using same format as original NDA  
   - Tabulations of new + original data  
   - Adverse event frequency comparison tables  
3. Retabulated premature discontinuations  
4. Case report forms and narrative summaries:  
   - Deaths  
   - Adverse event trial withdrawals  
   - Serious adverse events  
5. Update on: common, less serious adverse event incidence  
6. Updated subject/time exposure data  
7. Global post-market safety experience and use estimate  
8. English translations of any updated foreign labeling

---

## Instructions and Regulatory Path Forward

- Resubmission must address all deficiencies and be clearly marked "RESUBMISSION"  
- A partial response will not be processed or initiate a review cycle  
- FDA meetings/teleconferences available upon request  

The drug product may not be marketed until a written approval is issued.

## Previous Complete Response Letter (November 3, 2014)

### Deficiencies

#### 1. Food Effect and Dosing Variability

- Increases in TU, testosterone, DHT vary based on fat content of food  
- Uncontrolled fat intake → variable exposures → unpredictability in efficacy/safety  
- Data from Phase 3 trial not generalizable (preset meals on PK days only)

#### 2. Phase 3 Trial Deficiencies (CLAR-12011)

- T-Cavg success rate of 75% exactly, excludes ~19% of subjects  
- No key secondary endpoint success for testosterone Cmax outliers  
- Starting dose of 200 mg BID too high → frequent down-titration  
- ~25% of subjects ended with subtherapeutic T-Cavg (<300 ng/dL)  
- Elevated DHT levels and DHT/testosterone ratio  
- Not effective testosterone replacement

#### 3. Additional Safety Concerns

- Supraphysiologic DHT levels → androgen-related adverse effect risk  
- Unknown clinical significance of high TU and DHTU levels  
- SHBG reduction with unknown consequences  
- Increased BP, hematocrit, CV adverse events (MI, stroke)  
- Negative changes in HDL, hs-CRP (greater than with Androgel 1%)

#### Information Needed to Resolve

- Food effect study to evaluate dosing timing relative to meals  
- New Phase 3 trial with optimized dose/titration and validated meal timing  
- Consider effect on SHBG and bioavailable testosterone levels  
- Evaluate CV risk (BP, hematocrit, HDL)

#### Additional Investigation

- Impact of product on HPA axis (cortisol suppression in dogs)  
- Whether animal receptor affinity data is relevant to human AR  
- Possible pharmacologic effects of TU/DHTU or metabolites

---

## Proprietary Name

Review terminated pending correction of application deficiencies.

---

## Safety Update Requirements

(See above under "Safety Update Requirements")

---

## Additional Recommendations

- Conduct in vivo alcohol interaction study to assess impact on TU bioavailability

---

## Regulatory Instructions

- Action required within 1 year or application may be withdrawn under 21 CFR 314.65  
- Meetings with FDA encouraged to discuss path forward
