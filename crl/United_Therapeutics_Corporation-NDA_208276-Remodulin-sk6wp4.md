### NDA 208276  
### COMPLETE RESPONSE

United Therapeutics Corporation  
Attention: Rex Mauthe, MBA  
Associate Vice President, Regulatory Affairs  
55 T. W. Alexander Drive  
P.O. Box 14186  
Research Triangle Park, NC 27709

Dear Mr. Mauthe:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) originally submitted December 26, 2015, received December 26, 2015, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, for Implantable System for Remodulin (treprostinil) solution for injection.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated December 15, 2016, which constituted a complete response to our October 8, 2016, action letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

1. As noted in our October 8, 2016, Complete Response letter, the device component of this combination product received a Not Approvable letter on the PMA on March 11, 2016. Until such time as the device is determined to be approvable for use in combination with your proposed drug under this NDA, your NDA for the drug-device combination product cannot be approved.

2. Sufficient human factors (HF) data has not been provided to demonstrate that the Implantable System for Remodulin (ISR) user interface supports safe and effective use for the intended users, uses and use environments. Therefore, the original HF deficiencies included in the Not Approvable letter issued by FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) on March 11, 2016 and the HF deficiencies identified by CDRH on February 9, 2017, with respect to the PMA resubmission to CDRH, remain outstanding.

    Pursuant to 21 CFR 820.30, the ISR user interface, including the training plan, should be optimized and validated prior to approval to ensure the ISR can be used safely and effectively by the intended users, for the intended use, and in the intended use environment.

    We recommend that the device component of this combination product undergo:
    - A re-evaluation of the HF validation study results
    - Implementation of additional mitigations
    - Finalization of the intended training program
    - Submission of additional HF validation data

    These steps should demonstrate that representative users can use the product safely and effectively before the product is approved. Submit the HF validation study protocol for Agency review and feedback before commencing the study to ensure that the methodology is acceptable.

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

3. We reserve final comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We have, however, decided to incorporate the use of the Implantable System for Remodulin into the existing Remodulin label.

    When you resubmit your application, please propose a unified Prescribing Information incorporating use of the Implantable System for Remodulin in the existing label for Remodulin.

    We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) − a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

    If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure conformance. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

    - http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm

    To facilitate review:
    - Provide a highlighted or marked-up copy showing all changes
    - Provide a clean Microsoft Word version
    - Annotate marked-up copy with reasons for each proposed change

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

4. Please refer to correspondence dated April 7, 2017, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Implantable System for Remodulin. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle.

    Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug/product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
    - Present new safety data using the same format as in the original submission
    - Present tabulations of new safety data combined with original/supplemental application data
    - Include tables comparing frequencies of adverse events
    - For other indications, provide separate tables for frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials

3. Present a retabulation of reasons for premature trial discontinuation including drop-outs from newly completed trials. Describe new trends or patterns.

4. Provide:
    - Case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or did not complete due to an adverse event
    - Narrative summaries for serious adverse events

5. Describe any information suggesting a substantial change in incidence of common but less serious adverse events.

6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug/product. Include updated estimate of use in other countries.

8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

---

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions under 21 CFR 314.110. If no action is taken, your lack of response may be considered a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. You may request an extension of time.

A resubmission must fully address all deficiencies and be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large, bolded font on the cover letter. The cover letter should state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to deficiencies. A partial response will not be processed or start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss required steps for approval. Submit your meeting request as described in the draft FDA Guidance for Industry:

- *Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products*  
- March 2015  
- http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm437431.pdf

The drug product may not be legally marketed until written notification of application approval is received.

Attention: Rex Mauthe, MBA  
Associate Vice President, Regulatory Affairs  
55 T. W. Alexander Drive  
P.O. Box 14186  
Research Triangle Park, NC 27709

Dear Mr. Mauthe:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated December 16, 2015, received December 16, 2015, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the Remodulin (treprostinil) Implantable System.

We have completed our review and cannot approve the application in its present form.

---

## CLINICAL

1. The proposed device was submitted under a Premarket Approval Application (PMA). On March 11, 2016, FDA issued a Not Approvable letter on the PMA. Until the device is determined approvable, the NDA for the drug-device combination cannot be approved.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

2. There are insufficient data to evaluate patient exposure to microbial contaminants when Remodulin is used in the implanted system.

    The May 24, 2016 Medtronic response states:  
    > “The loss of m-Cresol ... would not impact microbial quality ... pump and catheter is a closed system.”

    However, there is no data demonstrating the catheter is a closed system regarding microbial ingress.

    **Action**: Provide data demonstrating that the device is a closed system concerning microbial ingress at the catheter tip.
