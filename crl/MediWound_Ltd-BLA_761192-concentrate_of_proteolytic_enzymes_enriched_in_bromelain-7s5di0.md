## BLA 761192 – COMPLETE RESPONSE

**MediWound, Ltd.**  
**c/o Vericel Corporation**  
**Attention: Michael Halpin**  
Chief Operating Officer  
64 Sidney Street  
Cambridge, MA 02139

Dear Mr. Halpin:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated and received June 29, 2020, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for “concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in bromelain” gel.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated April 16, 23, 30, and May 28, 2021 which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendments by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

### Botanical Raw Material

1. Botanical raw material (BRM) authentication is solely based on morphology. BRM authentication should include genetic, chemical, or biological methods with appropriate acceptance criteria. We acknowledge your response to the information request (IR) dated January 25, 2021, where you proposed to include biological and chemical assays as additional authentication methods. However, at this time, this continues to be a deficiency.

### Bromelain Special Production (BSP) and Drug Substance (DS) Microbiology

2. The overall microbial control strategy does not mitigate the risk of potential adventitious agents that may be introduced during the manufacturing process. The current BSP and DS manufacturing processes do not have adequate microbial control for in-process intermediates. Implement a microbial control strategy.

---

In summary, based on inspection observations, this study was not conducted in accordance with the protocol and current GCP standards, making the data generated from the inspected sites of poor quality.

Moreover, because of the significant unblinding events that occurred during the conduct of the study, the study data generated should be evaluated as if they were obtained from an open label study.

Provide your perspective on how these inspection observations impact the interpretability of the efficacy findings in Study MW2010-03-02.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

39. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources) and [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule) websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) − a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

40. Please refer to correspondence dated September 25, 2020, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, NexoBrid. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update. The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

41. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.  
42. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described in the bullet above.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.  
43. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.  
44. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.  
45. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.  
46. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).  
47. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this product. Include an updated estimate of use for product marketed in other countries.  
48. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:

### Botanical Raw Materials

49. We acknowledge you added chemical and biological assays to the release specifications for BRM in your response to the IR dated January 25, 2021. In addition, you provided your justifications of not including the tests of pesticide residuals, aflatoxins, and elemental impurities in the proposed release specifications for BRM. However, as discussed in the pre-BLA meeting dated November 14, 2019, and FDA’s IR dated December 19, 2020, quality control starts with the BRM. Therefore, we recommend for future manufacturing, that you:  
   - Follow USP <561> to conduct the tests and establish acceptance criteria for aflatoxins  
   - Follow USP <561> and the local regulations for pesticides (provide details on what local standards entail and what pesticides/herbicides were used during the cultivation of the pineapples and weed control for the pineapples used for the production of BSP)  
   - Clarify if the tests included in the BRM release specifications will cover all pesticides/herbicides used  
   - Follow USP <61> and <62> for microbial limits  
   - Follow USP <232> and <233> for elemental impurities  

### Documentation

55. In addition to the control of BRM, we recommend you conduct orthogonal analysis of chemical and biological data produced in BSP and/or drug substance (if applicable) and final product that were used in phase 3 trials. Subsequently, correlate the batch analysis to clinical outcomes to assess treatment-by-batch interactions and ultimately to ensure batch-to-batch consistency.

### Clinical Pharmacology

56. The completed maximal use study would not support the labeling that was submitted with the BLA application. If you desire to seek the labeling which is currently proposed, then you will need to conduct a new maximal use study designed to address the systemic safety of your product and support the proposed dosing regimens. In particular, you should ensure that you study adequate numbers of patients that are treated with two applications of the product who have % total body surface area (TBSA) within the upper range and are treated with doses within the upper range to support systemic safety and desired labeling.

57. If you choose to proceed with labeling in accordance with the currently completed maximal use study, then labeling will be restrictive in terms of number of applications, %TBSA and total dosing.
