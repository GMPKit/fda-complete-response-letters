Dear Dr. DiRoma:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated May 27, 2010, received May 28, 2010, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for (cladribine) Tablets.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment(s) dated between May 28, 2010 and December 1, 2010.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

Although we have concluded that cladribine is effective as a treatment for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), safety concerns associated with its use preclude its approval at this time.

### Efficacy

- Substantial evidence was provided by the CLARITY study (adequate, well-controlled).
- The effect of cladribine was demonstrated in:
  - Relapse rate
  - Disability progression
  - Imaging markers of disease activity
- These findings are robust and meet the standard for substantial evidence of effectiveness.

### Safety Concerns

- Increased risk of malignancy:
  - CLARITY trial: 4 malignancies in cladribine group, 0 in placebo
  - Overall: 33 malignancies in cladribine-treated subjects vs. 2 in placebo
  - Rates: 
    - Worldwide: 8.2/1000
    - U.S.: 18.3/1000

- No relationship found between malignancy and:
  - Cumulative dose
  - Duration of monitoring
  - Latency to diagnosis

- Additional safety concerns:
  - Lymphopenia
  - Risk factor imbalances
  - Long-term follow-up data biased
  - Risk analysis methods inadequate

### Requested Information

1. Clarify lymphopenia resolution timing in CLARITY.
2. Define plans for long-term cladribine dosing.
3. Provide data for:
   - Patients with prior use of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs)
   - Age-stratified malignancy risks
   - Drug combinations leading to additive lymphopenia

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

1. The proposed dissolution specification is not acceptable.  
   - Cladribine dissolves rapidly; update to reflect >% dissolved within 15 minutes.

---

## LABELING

Due to concerns, draft labeling is not included.

### Requested Revisions

- Submit revised carton and container labeling:
  - A. Carton Labeling and Tablet Holder Labeling (all quantities)
  - B. Carton Labeling (all quantities)
  - C. Blister Label (all quantities)
  - D. Tablet Holder Labeling (all quantities)
  - E. Packaging Design (all quantities)

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

When responding to deficiencies, include a safety update [21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b)]:

1. Detail changes in safety profile
2. Incorporate new data on:
   - Discontinuations due to AEs
   - SAEs
   - Common AEs
3. Retabulate premature trial discontinuation data
4. Provide narrative summaries and case reports for deaths and serious AEs
5. Note changes in incidence of common AEs
6. Include updated exposure data
7. Summarize global safety experience
8. Provide translations of foreign labeling

---

## OTHER

You must respond within one year (21 CFR 314.110). Partial responses will not be processed.

You may request a meeting as described in:
