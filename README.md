# FDA Complete Response Letters (CRL) â€“ Structured Repository

This repository contains a collection of **FDA Complete Response Letters (CRLs)**, converted from public domain PDF files into clean, searchable, and structured **Markdown files with YAML front matter**. The goal is to enable easier access, navigation, and large language model (LLM)-ready use of document set provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

---

## Repository Structure

Each CRL is stored as an individual Markdown (`.md`) file under the `/crl/` directory.

Each file includes:
- **YAML Front Matter**: machine-readable metadata such as application number, drug name, sponsor, document date, document type, and FDA contact.
- **Critical Data Summary**: a human-readable list of key fields extracted from the letter.
- **Clean Markdown Body**: converted from the original FDA PDF, preserving the original structure, formatting, and section headers.

---

## Use Cases

This repository is designed to support the following:

- **Regulatory Intelligence**  
  Identify common deficiencies, patterns in application types, and frequent issues cited by FDA divisions.

- **LLM-Ready Data**  
  Train or fine-tune GPTs, Claude, or open-source LLMs on structured FDA CRL content.

- **Search and Indexing**  
  Each Markdown file is structured for embedding-based search, GPT indexing, or use with tools like Obsidian, Dendron, or Weaviate.

- **Consulting and Compliance Review**  
  Reference past FDA responses when preparing applications or responses for biologics, small molecules, or cell therapies.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Use

You can:
1. Clone or fork the repo and browse documents locally or with a Markdown viewer.
2. Index the data into your own GPT or RAG-powered tool.
3. Use Obsidian or another Markdown-based knowledge tool for personal reference.

## ðŸ§  Credits & Inspiration

This project was inspired by the FDA's initiative for [transparency](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-embraces-radical-transparency-publishing-complete-response-letters):

"The CRLs were issued in response to applications submitted to the FDA for approval of drugs or biological products between 2020 and 2024, marking a significant step in the Agencyâ€™s broader initiatives to modernize and increase transparency."

This project was built on the dataset released on 10 July 2025, along with the need for more usable, machine-readable regulatory content in drug development, quality systems, and compliance work.

Built using:
- Documents in the public domain at [Open FDA](https://open.fda.gov/apis/other/approved_CRLs/)
- [`n8n`](https://n8n.io/) for workflow automation
- `OpenAI GPT` for formatting and metadata extraction
