### Clinical-Human Factor Studies

The submitted data from the human factors (HF) validation studies do not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that healthcare providers can reliably and accurately perform the Mannitol Tolerance Test (MTT) to correctly identify the intended target patient population. HF study results demonstrated several use errors and use difficulties with critical tasks in administering the MTT, which could result in healthcare providers prescribing the medication to patients who cannot tolerate mannitol inhalation powder. As inhaled mannitol is known to cause severe bronchospasm in susceptible individuals, this could result in patient harm (e.g., bronchospasm, hypoxia, pulmonary compromise) and is a significant safety concern.

To address this deficiency:

1. Revise the product user interface to address the errors and use difficulties seen in your HF validation studies.
2. Conduct a supplemental HF validation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the additional risk mitigations and to ensure that they address user interface concerns and do not introduce new risks.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the:

- [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:  
[Structured Product Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

## SAFETY UPDATE

When responding to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

### Include:

1. Description of significant changes or findings in the safety profile.  
2. Updated adverse events data:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables comparing frequencies of adverse events in the original and new data.
   - Provide separate tables for adverse events in trials for indications other than the proposed one.
3. Retabulation of reasons for premature trial discontinuation with inclusion of new trials; describe new trends or patterns.  
4. Case report forms and narrative summaries for patients:
   - Who died during a clinical trial.  
   - Who discontinued due to adverse events.  
   - Who experienced serious adverse events.  
5. Information suggesting significant changes in frequency of common but less serious adverse events compared to original data.  
6. Updated exposure information for the clinical trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).  
7. Summary of worldwide experience on product safety. Include updated estimate of global usage.  
8. English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. Failure to do so may be considered a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65.

### CLINICAL

The submitted data do not support a favorable benefit-risk balance for inhaled mannitol in cystic fibrosis patients aged 6 or older. Key issues:

- High dropout rates in Trial 301 not accounted for in primary analysis.  
- Lack of statistical significance for primary endpoint in Trial 302.  
- Sensitivity analyses of Trial 301 fail to confirm efficacy or are methodologically flawed.  
- Lack of support from secondary endpoints.  
- High incidence of hemoptysis in patients treated with mannitol, particularly pediatric patients, raising safety concerns.

### Recommendation:

To support approval, conduct at least one adequate clinical trial to demonstrate substantial evidence of efficacy and balance with safety findings.

## SAFETY UPDATE

When responding, include a safety update as per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b):

1. Describe significant safety changes or findings.  
2. Update adverse events data:
   - New data in same format as previous submission.  
   - Tabulated data combining new and original datasets.  
   - Comparative tables for adverse event frequencies.  
   - Separate tables for other indications.  
3. Updated tables for premature discontinuations, including from new trials.  
4. Case report forms and narrative summaries for deaths and serious adverse events.  
5. Report any notable changes in common, less severe adverse events.  
6. Exposure data (e.g., subject count, person time).  
7. Global safety experience and usage estimates.  
8. English translations of previously unsubmitted approved foreign labeling.

## OTHER

Respond within one year per 21 CFR 314.110. Failure to act may be deemed a withdrawal request under 21 CFR 314.65. You may request a meeting or call per [FDA Guidance – Formal Meetings](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM153222.pdf).
