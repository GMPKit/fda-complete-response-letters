### NDA 21-164  
**Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**  
Attention: Stephen J. Kramer M.D., Chief Executive Officer  
5847 San Felipe, Suite 2000  
Houston, Texas 77057  

Dear Dr. Kramer,

Please refer to your new drug application dated September 30, 1999, received October 1, 1999, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for:

- **Gepirone Hydrochloride Extended Release**  
  - 20 mg  
  - 40 mg  
  - 60 mg  
  - 80 mg tablets

We acknowledge receipt of your submissions dated May 1, 2007, July 13, 2007, and October 8, 2007. The May 1, 2007 submission constituted a complete response to our June 23, 2004, action letter.

We have completed our review and find the information presented is inadequate. Therefore, the application is not approvable under section 505(d) of the Act and 21 CFR 314.125(b). The deficiencies are summarized:

---

## Non-Approval Deficiencies

### 1. Inadequate Evidence of Effectiveness

- You have failed to provide **substantial evidence** for the effectiveness of gepirone ER in the short-term or longer-term treatment of **major depressive disorder (MDD)**.
- Two well-controlled trials (FKGBE007 and 134001) show significant effects.
- However, the remaining 10 of 12 studies failed to show supportive outcomes or trends.

#### Trial Summary (Active Comparator vs. Gepirone ER):

| Trial      | Comparator  | Result (p-value)     |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| ORG 134004 | Fluoxetine  | -1.71 (p=0.027)      |
| ORG 134017 | Fluoxetine  | -1.54 (p=0.042)      |
| ORG 134006 | Paroxetine  | -1.85 (p=0.012)      |

#### Trial Summary (Comparator vs Placebo vs Gepirone ER):

| Trial      | Comparator  | Comparator vs. Placebo | Gepirone ER vs Placebo |
|------------|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| CN105-053  | Imipramine  | -3.19 (p=0.038)        | -2.00 (p=0.190)         |
| ORG 134006 | Paroxetine  | -1.63 (p=0.026)        | 0.22 (p=0.760)          |

- In 5 trials with active comparators, 3 showed clear assay sensitivity but failed to show a gepirone effect.

### 2. Meta-Analysis Results

- Using your meta-analytic model for the 10 failed studies:  
  - Effect size: **-0.09 (p=0.62)**
- Using all 12 trials:  
  - Effect size: **-0.48 (p=0.09)**

### 3. Study 28709 (Longer-term Maintenance Study)

- Attempted to reclassify 40 "protocol violators" post hoc is not credible or valid.
- This trial failed despite design similarities to other successful antidepressant trials.

### 4. Clinical Implications

- Even if another positive study were completed, the available data show inferiority to standard therapy.
- Gepirone ER may be significantly **less effective** than current antidepressants.
- Some evidence of lesser sexual dysfunction risk, but not consistent or sufficient to outweigh lower efficacy.

---

## Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Deficiencies

1. Revise acceptance criteria for individual unspecified impurity per **ICH Q3B** guideline.  
2. Provide long-term and accelerated stability data for the **to-be-marketed** product in each packaging configuration.

---

## Regulatory Requirements

- Within **10 days** of this letter, you must:  
  - Amend the application  
  - Notify intent to amend  
  - Follow options under **21 CFR 314.120**

**Attention:** Edna Gilvary, Ph.D.  
Regulatory Scientist II  
375 Mount Pleasant Avenue  
West Orange, NJ 07052  

Dear Dr. Gilvary,

Please refer to your NDA dated September 30, 1999, for **Gepirone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets** (20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, 80 mg).

---

### Timeline Acknowledged

- Submissions received: December 23, 2003; February 9, 27; March 19; April 5; May 19, 2004  
- December 23, 2003: complete response to March 15, 2002, action letter

---

## Application Not Approvable  
Under section 505(d) and 21 CFR 314.125(b)

---

## Non-Approval Deficiencies

### Efficacy Concerns

- Only two positive short-term studies (134001 - ER; 03A7A-003 - IR)  
- Study 28709 (long-term maintenance): **not positive**  
- Study 134004: failed to distinguish gepirone from placebo; fluoxetine favored over gepirone

---

### Study 28709 Analysis Issues

1. **Five relapsed patients excluded** inappropriately after unblinding:  
   - Including them changes p-value from **p=0.024 to p=0.101**

2. **Exclusion of ITT patients**:  
   - P-values remain non-significant  
   - With proper inclusion: p=0.33 and p=0.31

3. **Time-to-relapse analysis**:  
   - Without 5 patients: p=0.089  
   - With 5 patients: p=0.28

---

## Agency Conclusions

- 2 positive short-term trials out of 19 = insufficient  
- Study 28709 failure = further doubt about efficacy  
- Gepirone considered **significantly less effective** than available agents

---

## Proposed Tradename - Unacceptable

- **"Variza"**: similar sounding/looking drugs exist  
- **"Alrize"**: misleading  
- Submit new tradename

---

## Labeling Comments

### A. Blister Label (Starter Kit)

- Include strength, net quantity, and ingredient statement  
- Distinguish strengths clearly

### B. Professional Sample Container

- Address same issues from A-2 and A-4

### C. Container Label (All Strengths)

- Emphasize established name, relocate strength, differentiate strengths, add CRC statement (30 ct)

### D. Carton Labeling

- Apply comments C-1, C-3, and C-4

---

## Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls

1. Provide updated stability protocol & data  
2. Remove site: Organon Inc. Sub Akzona Inc. (closing)  
3. Confirm alternate release sites

---

## Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics

1. Evaluate modified tablet shapes: 40, 60 mg **not acceptable**  
2. Interim dissolution specs acceptable; must be reevaluated after 20 batches  
3. Phase 4 Commitments:  
   - Effect of intermediate inducers (e.g., rifabutin)  
   - In vivo food-effect study (ongoing)  
   - Reevaluate dissolution specs after 20 batches

---

## Regulatory Instructions

- Respond within **10 days**  
- Only responses addressing **all deficiencies** will be reviewed
