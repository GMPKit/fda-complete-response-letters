# BLA 761338/Original 2

U.S. Food and Drug Administration  
Silver Spring, MD 20993  
www.fda.gov

The subject of this correspondence is BLA 761338/Original 2. A separate correspondence was issued for BLA 761338/Original 1.

All future submissions to these BLAs should specify the BLA number and the Original number to which each submission pertains.

We have completed a provisional review of this application, as amended. A final determination under sections 351(i) and 351(k) of the PHS Act that:

- **Steqeyma (ustekinumab-stba)** injection 45 mg/0.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringe for subcutaneous use would be interchangeable with **Stelara (ustekinumab)** injection 45 mg/0.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringe for subcutaneous use
- **Steqeyma (ustekinumab-stba)** injection 90 mg/mL single-dose prefilled syringe for subcutaneous use would be interchangeable with **Stelara (ustekinumab)** injection 90 mg/mL single-dose prefilled syringe for subcutaneous use
- **Steqeyma (ustekinumab-stba)** injection 130 mg/26 mL single-dose vial for intravenous use would be interchangeable with **Stelara (ustekinumab)** injection 130 mg/26 mL single-dose vial for intravenous use

is currently subject to unexpired exclusivity for the first interchangeable biosimilar biological products, and thus may not be made before the exclusivity has expired. See section 351(k)(6) of the PHS Act.

We have not identified any deficiencies that would justify a complete response action at this time; however, we also cannot approve your application because of the unexpired first interchangeable exclusivity. We have therefore provisionally determined that your 351(k) application meets the interchangeability criteria under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.

This provisional determination is based upon information available to the Agency at this time (i.e., information in your application and that the manufacturing of the biological product complies with the standards established in the BLA as well as the requirements in applicable regulations). This determination is subject to change on the basis of any new information that may come to our attention.

To obtain approval of this application:

- Submit an amendment no more than six months prior to the date you believe that your application will be eligible for approval.
- In your cover letter, clearly identify your amendment as **"REQUEST FOR APPROVAL."**
- This amendment should provide the legal/regulatory basis for your request for approval and should include a copy of any relevant supporting documentation, as appropriate.
- Include a safety update.
- Identify changes, if any, in the application, i.e.,
  - updated labeling;
  - chemistry, manufacturing, and controls data;
  - risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS).
  - If there are no changes, clearly state so.

# Final Rule

FDA websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) — a checklist of important format items from labeling regulations and guidances. In addition, we encourage you to review the FDA guidance for industry **“Labeling for Biosimilar Products.”**

# Carton and Container Labeling

- We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

---

# Proprietary Name

Please refer to correspondence dated, September 29, 2023, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, **Steqeyma**. This name was found conditionally acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle.

Resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to all of the application deficiencies that have been identified in this letter.

---

# Safety Update

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update. The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile and their relevance, if any, to whether there may be clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar product and the US-licensed reference product.

2. When assembling the sections describing:
   - Discontinuations due to adverse events
   - Serious adverse events
   - Common adverse events

   Incorporate new safety data as follows:

   - Present new safety data from the clinical studies for the proposed indication using the same format as the original BLA submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original BLA data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original BLA with the retabulated frequencies described above.

# Product Quality

## Drug Substance

[Redacted due to confidential commercial information]

## Drug Product

9. As indicated in the proposed labeling, individual pre-filled syringes or vials may be stored at room temperature up to 30 °C for a maximum single period of up to [REDACTED] days in the carton. You provided stability data under the accelerated 2 condition using representative DP lots to support the labeled in-use storage for CT-P43 at room temperature prior to administration or dilution. However:

- It appears end of shelf-life samples were not tested for in-use stability data under accelerated 2 condition.
- To ensure in-use room temperature stability of:
  - 130 mg/36 mL (5 mg/mL) single-dose vial
  - 45 mg/0.5 mL PFS
  - 90 mg/mL PFS CT-P43 drug products

  Provide additional stability testing under the accelerated 2 condition using end of shelf-life DP samples.

- Also provide additional in-use stability testing of end of shelf-life DP vial samples after the maximum [REDACTED] days of room temperature storage.

10. We note that you only provided an in-use compatibility study with [REDACTED] IV bag. If you intend for the product to be used with other common bags such as [REDACTED] or [REDACTED], we recommend studies to support those.

11. The information for some responses in Section 1.11.1 in SN 0027 received on May 13, 2024, was incomplete and/or inaccurate. For example:

- Response to information request 4 was not submitted.
- Response to information request 2 was submitted twice in Quality Information Amendment 2 and 4.

Revise the quality information amendment to provide accurate and complete responses to the quality information request dated May 3, 2024, in your BLA re-submission.
