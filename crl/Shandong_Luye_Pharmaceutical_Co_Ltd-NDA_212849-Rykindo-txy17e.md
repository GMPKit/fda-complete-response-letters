- **Product:** Rykindo (risperidone) extended-release injectable suspension
- **Application Date Received:** March 28, 2019
- **Complete Response Submitted:** August 19, 2021

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and determined that we cannot approve it in its present form.

## Clinical and Clinical Pharmacology

The January 28, 2020 Complete Response letter advised:

- Conducting a root-cause analysis to explain concentration spikes in Study LY03004/CT-USA-102.

### FDA Findings:

- Re-analysis detected cocaine in two subjects but this does not adequately explain the spikes:
  - FDA disagrees with the sponsor's conclusion that cocaine, as a CYP2D6 inhibitor, is responsible.
  - The extent of concentration increase (300â€“500%) exceeds known data for CYP2D6 inhibitors.
  - Cocaine is not established as a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor.

### Requirement for Resubmission:

- Provide detailed PK data (mean and individual subject) for all clinical trials conducted outside the U.S., including:
  - China, European Union
  - Real-world drug use data
  - Ongoing studies for PK and safety insights
- Adverse events of special interest must be reported, including:
  - Summaries for subjects with suspected dose-dumping
  - Vital signs and ECG data

---

## Product Quality

### Biopharmaceutics Deficiency:

- Biowaiver for 12.5 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg strengths cannot be granted due to unresolved clinical concerns.
- Adequate resolution of clinical/pharmacology issues is required to establish bioequivalence between proposed and Listed Drug.

---

## Prescribing Information

- Comment is reserved until application is otherwise adequate.
- Refer to these guidance resources:
  - [Prescription Drug Labeling Resources](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/laws-acts-and-rules/prescription-drug-labeling-resources)
  - [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/labeling-information-drug-products/pregnancy-and-lactation-labeling-drugs-final-rule)

Include updated content of labeling per 21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i).

---

## Carton and Container Labeling

- Comment reserved until application is otherwise adequate.

---

## Proprietary Name

- Correspondence dated December 9, 2021:
  - Name "Rykindo" is acceptable, pending application approval.
  - Resubmit name during response to this complete response letter.

---

## Safety Update

- Submit a safety update per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b), including all relevant data.
- Include the following:

  1. Significant changes or findings in the safety profile  
  2. Updated data on:  
     - Discontinuations due to AEs  
     - Serious AEs  
     - Common AEs  
     - New tabulations  
     - Comparison tables with original application data  
     - Separate AE tables for non-target indications  
  3. Retabulated trial discontinuations, trends  
  4. Case report forms and narratives for deaths and serious AEs  
  5. Changes in incidence of commonly observed AEs  
  6. Updated clinical trial exposure data  
  7. Summary of global postmarket safety experience  
  8. English translations of current approved foreign labels

---

## Other Instructions

- You must resubmit within 1 year (21 CFR 314.110) or provide justification for delay.
- We may consider lack of response a request to withdraw the application (21 CFR 314.65).

## Second COMPLETE RESPONSE (January 28, 2020)

**Attention:** Li Wan, PhD, RAC  
**Title:** Director, Head of Global Regulatory Affairs

## Clinical and Clinical Pharmacology

- FDA acknowledges adequate PK bridging with Risperdal CONSTA based on steady-state bioequivalence.
- However, significant safety concerns remain:

### Issues Identified:

- Three subjects in Study LY03004/CT-USA-102 had unexplained high spikes in concentration (up to 100 ng/mL).
- These spikes:
  - Represent ~5x the average at 25 mg dose
  - Suggest potential exposure of ~200 ng/mL at 50 mg dose
  - Pose serious safety risks

### Required Actions:

1. Conduct a root-cause analysis  
2. Implement plans to prevent similar risks post-marketing

---

## Product Quality

### Noted Deficiencies:

- Justify any manufacturing scale-up differences and their lack of impact on PK, efficacy, and safety.  
- Justify observed differences in drug release profiles for commercial batches.

> Consider developing an IVIVC or IVIVR model.

### Biowaiver

Not granted for 12.5 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg strengths due to:

1. Unresolved PK spike concerns  
2. Inadequate in vitro release data

Submit:

- In vitro release comparison (n=12) using full to-be-marketed formulation  
- Estimated f2 similarity factors or equivalent

---

## Use-Related Risk Analysis (URRA)

- Submitted May 6, 2019; incomplete  
- Does not account for failure to re-suspend microspheres

### Instructions:

- Conduct/update URRA  
- Possibly conduct a human factors validation study  
  - Submit protocol in advance for feedback (60-day review)  
  - Place results in eCTD Section 5.3.5.4

### Related Guidance:

- [Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices](https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm)  
- [Safety Considerations for Product Design to Minimize Medication Errors](https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm)

---

## Facility Inspections

- Inspection noted deficiencies  
- Satisfactory resolution required before approval

---

## Additional Comments (Non-approvability)

1. Develop IVIVC/IVIVR model:  
   - Proposed method lacks reconstitution step  
   - No individual strength release testing  
   - High-risk delivery method requiring further justification

2. Investigate heat impact on drug release and PK profile

---

## Prescribing Information

Comment reserved until application is otherwise adequate.
