# COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER  
**CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH**  
**APPLICATION NUMBER:** 761088Orig1s000  
**BLA 761088**  
**CELLTRION, Inc.**  
**Date:** February 28, 2018

## INTRODUCTION

Please refer to your Biologics License Application (BLA) dated April 28, 2017, received April 28, 2017, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for CT-P10.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

During a recent inspection of the Celltrion, Inc. (FEI 3005241015) manufacturing facility, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of the deficiencies is required before this BLA may be approved.

---

## CLINICAL

You have not provided adequate information and scientific justification that Study CT-P10 3.3, in patients with advanced follicular lymphoma, is adequate to detect differences between the products, should they exist, to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences between CT-P10 and US-licensed Rituxan in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.

You need to provide additional information and justification to address the uncertainty raised by observed differences, specifically in objective response rate (ORR) and adverse events, in Study CT-P10 3.3.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

1. The cell culture process characterization and assessment were inadequate. Your control during manufacture is inadequate.  
2. Proposed ranges for certain process parameters exceed validation ranges. Revise section 3.2.S.2.2 to limit ranges or provide justification with data.  
3. Information submitted on November 21 and 28, 2017, was not incorporated into section 3.2.S.2.2. Update this section accordingly.  
4. The ranges for chromatography columns lack sufficient control. Assign and justify target values using PPQ and commercial manufacturing data.  
5. Product fragments:
    - Identify process unit operations impacting fragments  
    - Provide control strategy for product fragments  
6. Deamidation at HC Asn55: Provide data verifying test method can detect changes  
7. Afucosylation:
    - Propose DS specifications for afucosylated glycans  
    - Provide assay validation data  
    - Provide DS lot release and stability data  
8. Stability testing plan for CT-P10 master/working cell banks not submitted. Update section 3.2.S.2.3.2.  
9. FcγRIIIa binding affinity:
    - No DP long-term storage data at 5±3°C provided  
    - Provide data or include this testing in the DP stability program  
10. Polysorbate 80 (PS80): Provide data supporting proposed minimum concentration limit  
11. Fill weight failure in 100 mg DP vials: Update section 3.2.P.3.5 to note corrupted vials are quarantined and discarded  
12. Media fill simulation:
    - Not conducted with CT-P10 100 mg primary container system  
    - Conduct 3 simulations and include report  
13. Dye penetration: Use breach size close to limit of detection  
14. Bacterial retention study:
    - Cell viability incomplete over 8-hour contact  
    - Provide bacterial growth study data for B. diminuta  
15. Equipment sterilization validation is insufficient. Provide full data and description
