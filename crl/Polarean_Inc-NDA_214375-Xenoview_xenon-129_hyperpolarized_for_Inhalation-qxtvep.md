Dear Dr. Mercer,

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated October 5, 2020, received October 5, 2020, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Xenoview (xenon-129 hyperpolarized) for Inhalation.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

The Approvability Issues (deficiencies), with recommendations to address them, are as follows:

### A. Drug Substance and Drug Product

1. The degree of polarization of xenon-129 hyperpolarized is a critical quality attribute of the drug component in your drug-device combination product.
   - Establish specification and acceptance limits with tolerances with adequate justification per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(ii)(a).
   - Include measurements from clinical batches of xenon-129 hyperpolarized produced by the device and proposed commercial batches.
   - Submit a table with batch results, batch identification number/date, and batch use.

2. Validate the production method of xenon-129 hyperpolarized using at least three different batches of gas blend on a commercial hyperpolarizer.
   - Registration batches must meet final drug specification and be produced under cGMP with documented yield data.
   - Submit master and executed batch records for production.

3. Propose a strength for the drug product xenon-129 hyperpolarized.
   - Example: range of % xenon-129 enrichment and % hyperpolarization per volume.

### B. Device Design Changes and Release

4. Provide the final approval procedure and approved release documents for finished devices.

5. Provide a comparative list of all Hyperpolarizer changes, including:
   - Verification protocol/testing data
   - Detailed description and material characteristics
   - Comparative analysis with versions used in clinical studies

### C. Device Reliability

6. Submit reliability assessment reports for the Hyperpolarizer and QC Measurement system.
   - Include verification protocol, analytical methods, specifications, acceptance criteria, and final report.
