Dear Dr. Gunto:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated May 17, 2012, received May 18, 2012, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for mannitol inhalation powder, 40 mg.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated December 19, 2018, which constituted a complete response to our March 18, 2013, action letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

### Clinical-Human Factor Studies

The submitted data from the human factors (HF) validation studies do not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that healthcare providers can reliably and accurately perform the Mannitol Tolerance Test (MTT) to correctly identify the intended target patient population.

HF study results demonstrated several use errors and use difficulties with critical tasks in administering the MTT, which could result in healthcare providers prescribing the medication to patients who cannot tolerate mannitol inhalation powder. As inhaled mannitol is known to cause severe bronchospasm in susceptible individuals, this could result in patient harm (e.g., bronchospasm, hypoxia, pulmonary compromise) and is a significant safety concern.

To address this deficiency:

1. Revise the product user interface to address the errors and use difficulties seen in your HF validation studies.
2. Conduct a supplemental HF validation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the additional risk mitigations and to ensure that they address user interface concerns and do not introduce new risks.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the:

- [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm)
- [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)

Use the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) checklist to ensure compliance with format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

Your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at:

- [Structured Product Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

## PROPRIETARY NAME

Please refer to correspondence dated March 19, 2019, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Bronchitol. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:
   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this product. Include an updated estimate of use for product marketed in other countries.

8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.110.

### CLINICAL

The submitted data do not provide a favorable benefit-risk balance to support the use of inhaled mannitol in patients with cystic fibrosis 6 years of age and older.

Problems include:

- Treatment-related frequent early dropouts in Trial 301 were not properly accounted for in the primary statistical analyses.
- Lack of statistical significance in Trial 302 for the primary endpoint.
- Sensitivity analyses for Study 301 fail to confirm treatment effect or are problematic in data imputation.
- Lack of support from secondary endpoints in both studies.
- Safety concerns, particularly higher occurrence of hemoptysis in pediatric subjects treated with mannitol 400 mg.

To support approval:

- Conduct a clinical program including at least one adequate clinical trial to show substantial evidence of efficacy in cystic fibrosis patients, while balancing safety outcomes.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

Include a safety update in your response as per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). This update must include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies, regardless of indication or dose.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. For discontinuations due to adverse events:
   - Present new safety data using consistent format.
   - Provide tabulations combining new and original data.
   - Include comparative tables.
   - Provide separate tables for other indications.

3. Retabulate reasons for premature trial discontinuations.

4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries:
   - For patients who died during trials.
   - For serious adverse events.

5. Describe substantial changes in incidence of minor adverse events.

6. Update exposure information for all trials.

7. Provide summary of worldwide safety experience, including foreign usage estimates.

8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.
