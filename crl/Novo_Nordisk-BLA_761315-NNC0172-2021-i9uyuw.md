Please refer to your Biologics License Application (BLA) dated and received August 24, 2022, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for NNC0172-2021 injection.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated April 19, 2023, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

1. Despite fixed maintenance doses of NNC0172-2021, significant fluctuations in concentrations were noted. At target exposure (200–4000 ng/mL), TMDD plays a dominant role, leading to:
   - Rapid clearance
   - Shorter half-life
   - Subtherapeutic levels if doses are missed

   **Recommendations:**
   - Provide a plan for dosing after missed doses
   - Consider additional PK monitoring or repeat loading dose
   - Emphasize adherence to daily dosing in labeling and educational materials
   - Justify single PK monitoring after four weeks or propose more frequent testing

---

## DEVICE

2. ELISA validation is inadequate:
   - Cross-validation study must include a sufficient number of native samples with varied drug levels (<200, 200–4000, >4000 ng/mL)

3. Precision study:
   - Include instrument-to-instrument and lot-to-lot precision

4. Specificity/interference:
   - Substances requiring dose-response study: hemoglobin, cholesterol, triglyceride, Factor VII (NOVOSeven), biotin, ledipasvir, acetaminophen

5. Provide sample stability data using NNC0172-2021 ELISA

6. Provide root-cause analysis of underestimation issues in certain validation studies

> CDRH recommends post-action meeting to review the above.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

9. Response to IR on control strategy is inadequate. Address risks pertaining to product safety and efficacy and revise the control strategy to ensure quality.

10. DS (Drug Substance) release and stability specifications:
    - For sections 3.2.S.4.1 and 3.2.S.4.5
    - Revise inadequate acceptance criteria

11. DP (Drug Product) release and stability specifications:
    - For sections 3.2.P.5.1 and 3.2.P.5.6
    - Address inadequacies in batch-to-batch consistency

12. MCB and WCB stability protocols:
    - Revise protocols to ensure consistent cell bank performance

13. PRM and SRM stability protocols:
    - Revise to ensure stability control of reference materials

14. DS post-approval stability protocol:
    - Revise Table 4 in section 3.2.S.7.2

15. DP post-approval stability:
    - Revise Table 1 in section 3.2.P.8.2

16. Identity testing and tracking:
    - Revise section 3.2.P.3.3 to specify physical identifiers (e.g., cap color)

### Device Constituent

17. Include EPRs (dose accuracy, activation force, hold force, injection time) in DP post-approval stability protocol

18. Include same EPRs in DP release specifications

---

## FACILITY INSPECTION

19. Inspection of manufacturing facility revealed deficiencies. Approval dependent on satisfactory resolution.
