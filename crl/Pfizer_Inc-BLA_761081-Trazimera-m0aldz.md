### OTHER ACTION LETTERS  

**DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES**

**COMPLETE RESPONSE**

Pfizer Inc.  
Attention: Scott C. Anderson, MS  
Director, Biosimilars Global Regulatory Affairs  
10646 Science Center Drive  
San Diego, CA 92121  

Dear Mr. Anderson:

Please refer to your Biologics License Application (BLA) dated June 22, 2017, received June 22, 2017, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for Trazimera (PF-05280014).  
We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated March 26, 2018, April 10, 2018, and April 17, 2018, which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendments by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## PRODUCT QUALITY

1. **Cell Bank Stability:**  
   - WCB data do not support suitability for commercial production.  
   - MCB data are insufficient.  
   - Confirm MCB stability or qualify a new WCB.

2. **Fill Weight Range:**  
   - Extractable Content data do not support lower fill weight.  
   - Adjust limit and provide data to demonstrate vials meet label claim (420 mg).

3. **Shipping Validation:**  
   - Provide simulated shipping performance data (vibration/shock).  
   - Provide stability data for temps outside 2–8°C range.  
   - Validate passive shipper seasonal performance.

4. **Specifications (PF-05280114):**  
   a. ADCC activity – add surrogate assay (e.g., FcγRIIIa).  
   b. Iso Asp102 – implement direct control assay.  
   c. High mannose – include total content in DS spec.  
   d. Polysorbate 20 – quantify in DP spec.  
   e. Extractable content – require ≥ 420 mg in DP spec.

5. **Specification Justifications:**  
   - Specifications must reflect experience; tighten as necessary:  
     - Appearance (Color): DS release/shelf life  
     - Acidic/Basic species: DS/DP release & shelf life

6. **Unsupported Storage Conditions:**  
   - Provide supporting data:  
     - 30°C for 3 months (unopened)  
     - 2–8°C for 28 days (BWFI reconstitution)

7. **Method Validations:**  
   - Reduced/non-reduced CGE methods at Pfizer St. Louis need validation evidence.

8. **Risky Operation:**  
   - Section 3.2.S.2.2 – submit supporting data or remove.

9. **Media Fills:**  
   - Include summary of 3 fill simulations.

10. **Hold Time:**  
    - Submit microbial data to support hold time.

11. **Capping Ops:**  
    - Set max differential force limits.  
    - Demonstrate container closure integrity.

12. **Vial Washing:**  
    - Data from 3 validations per washer required.  
    - Include drug product and diluent parameters.

13. **Bioburden Limits:**  
    - Establish and include in resubmission.

14. **Low Endotoxin Recovery (LER):**  
    - Submit full study report.  
    - Clarify use of CSE vs. RSE standard.

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Comment is reserved until application is otherwise adequate.

- Review PLR requirements, labeling rule, SRPI checklist.  
- Update labeling content in SPL format per 21 CFR 601.14(b).

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

Comment is reserved until application is otherwise adequate.

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

- September 18, 2017 correspondence noted rejection of "Trazimera".  
- Resubmit proposed proprietary name upon response.

---

## SAFETY UPDATE

Safety update required with BLA response should include:

1. Description of new safety findings and potential significance.  
2. Updated safety data in original BLA format:  
   - Separately and integrated with prior data.  
   - Comparative adverse event tables.

3. Premature discontinuations retabulated, with trend summaries.  
4. Case report forms and narratives for serious events or deaths.  
5. Incidence shifts in non-serious events summarized.  
6. Updated exposure data (subjects, person-time).  
7. Integrated global safety experience data (AEs, immunogenicity, usage).  
8. Translations of previously unsubmitted foreign labels.

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

These are not approvability issues but require attention:

1. **Size Variant Limits Too Broad:**  
   - Based on SE-HPLC and CGE; justify or tighten.

2. **Rejection Limit:**  
   - 3.2.S.2.2 standard must reflect scale-up data.

3. **Process Data Inadequate:**  
   - Submit development data or narrow ranges.

4. **FcγRIIIa Assay Stability:**  
   - Demonstrate stability indication with stressed samples.

5. **HCP ELISA Coverage:**  
   - Assay coverage for PF-05280014 cell line needs substantiation.

6. **HPLC Method Selectivity:**  
   - Update selectivity criteria for cation exchange and size exclusion.

7. **Sterilization Validation:**  
   - Should be specific to product and submitted in 3.2.P.3.5.

8. **Acceptance Criteria vs. Control Limits:**  
   - Include as acceptance criteria where applicable in 3.2.P.3.4.
