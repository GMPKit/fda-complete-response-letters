## Application Information

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated February 28, 2017, received February 28, 2017, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for solifenacin succinate oral suspension, 1 mg/mL.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## Deficiencies

1. During a recent inspection of manufacturing facility for this NDA, our field investigator observed objectionable conditions at the facility and conveyed that information to the representative of the facility at the close of the inspection. Satisfactory resolution of the observations is required before this NDA may be approved.

2. The quality of one component, as currently supplied, is not adequately controlled, resulting in drug product batches that do not meet the proposed drug product specification.

3. The drug product specification and post-approval stability program do not include the test methods and acceptance criteria to demonstrate that the product is free, and remains free, of the objectionable microorganisms in the formulation.

---

## Information Needed to Address the Deficiencies

To address the first two deficiencies, submit the following information:

- Results from the ongoing characterization studies, including a summary of your investigations and the corrective and preventive actions taken to address the root cause.

- Establish and validate additional tests and acceptance criteria.

- Batch analyses from three verification/validation batches demonstrating that drug product manufactured with ingredients meeting the NF and additional quality requirements has the requisite quality (e.g., viscosity). Include executed batch records from the validation batches along with the validation protocol and the final summary report.

If suitable additional controls cannot be identified and validated or if the supplier is unable to meet the enhanced raw material specification, revision of the acceptance criteria for drug product viscosity may be proposed. Provide justification and confirm with release and stability data that quality and performance, including homogeneity, are not negatively impacted.

To address the third deficiency:

- Revise the drug product specification to include the test method(s) and acceptance criteria to assure that the product is free of objectionable microorganisms. Update the relevant sections of the application accordingly.

- Revise the post-approval stability program to include testing to confirm the absence of objectionable microbial growth.

---

## Additional Comments

- Update **Table 12**, Specifications for Solifenacin Succinate Oral Suspension (in Module 2.3.P Drug Product Quality Overall Summary), to reflect that microbial limit tests will be performed on every batch.

- Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) (21 U.S.C. 355a), FDA will publish a notice identifying any drug for which, on or after the enactment of the BPCA of 2007, a pediatric formulation was developed, studied, and found to be safe and effective but is not marketed within a year of exclusivity being granted (August 10, 2017, in this case).

---

## Prescribing Information

Your proposed prescribing information (PI) must conform to content and format regulations under 21 CFR 201.56(a), (d) and 201.57.

- Submit a clean Word version  
- Include annotations supporting any proposed changes

Updated content must be submitted in SPL format as outlined at:

---

## Carton and Container Labeling

Submit revised draft carton and container labeling based on FDA proposals dated May 3, 2017, and May 24, 2017.

---

## Proprietary Name

---

## Facility Inspections

Deficiencies observed during the manufacturing facility inspection must be satisfactorily resolved before approval.

---

## Safety Update

Include a safety update per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b) when responding to deficiencies. Include:

1. Any new significant findings in the safety profile.

2. Updated discontinuations and adverse event tabulations:
   - Use the same format as original submission.
   - Combine new and original data.
   - Provide comparison tables.
   - Separate tables for safety from trials in other indications.

3. Retabulated premature trial discontinuations and any new trends.

4. Case report forms and narratives for:
   - Deaths
   - Discontinuations due to adverse events
   - Serious adverse events

5. Changes in incidence of common adverse events.

6. Updated clinical study exposure data.

7. A summary of global safety experience and marketing use.

8. English translations of any foreign labeling not previously provided.

---

## Other

Within one year of this letter, resubmit or take other action per 21 CFR 314.110. Otherwise, the NDA may be considered withdrawn under 21 CFR 314.65.
