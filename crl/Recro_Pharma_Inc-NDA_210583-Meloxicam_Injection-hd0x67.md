# CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH  
## APPLICATION NUMBER: 210583Orig1s000  
### COMPLETE RESPONSE

**To:**  
Recro Pharma Inc.  
490 Lapp Road  
Malvern, PA 19355  
Attention: Diane P. Myers, SVP, Regulatory and Quality

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received July 26, 2017, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), for Meloxicam Injection, 30 mg/mL.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated September 24, 2018, which constituted a complete response to our May 23, 2018, action letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

1. **Onset of Action and Duration**
   - Onset: 2 to 3 hours (possibly longer if early rescue patients excluded).
   - Inadequate for IV acute pain monotherapy.
   - Analgesic effect wanes ~18 hours post-dosing → not suitable for 24-hour dosing intervals.
   - Proposal to label based on pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling fails to address these deficiencies.

   a. **Efficacy**
   - No viable exposure/response relationship.
   - High plasma meloxicam early, but pain relief only reported after 2–3 hours.
   - Minimal change in plasma levels 18–24 hours (1700 → 1500 ng/mL).
   - Does not support revised dosing interval.

   b. **Safety**
   - Limited data to support safety.
   - NSAID adverse events are dose/exposure-related.
   - PK-model predicted meloxicam levels at shorter intervals exceed those with current 24-hour dosing.

2. **Prescribing Information**
   - Comment reserved until application is otherwise adequate.
   - Review:
     - [PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Labeling/ucm093103.htm)
     - [Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm)
   - Use SRPI checklist to revise labeling in SPL format:  
     [Structured Product Labeling (SPL)](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

## CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

3. Refer to revised draft submitted February 25, 2019. Resubmit with the following changes:

   **1. Container Label**
   - Add lot number per 21 CFR 201.10(i)(1).
   - Add expiration date per 21 CFR 201.17 and 211.137.
   - Recommended formats:
     - YYYY-MM-DD (numeric)
     - YYYY-MMM-DD (alphabetic month)
     - If space-limited: YYYY-MM or YYYY-MMM

   **2. Carton Labeling - Single Vial**
   - Review 2018 FDA guidance on product identifiers under Drug Supply Chain Security Act:  
     [Draft Guidance PDF](https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-drugsgen/documents/document/ucm621044.pdf)

   **3. Carton Labeling**
   - Same requirements as above.

2. For discontinuations, serious adverse events, and common adverse events:
   - Present new safety data as originally formatted.

   - Primary endpoints met in Studies REC-15-015 and REC-15-016.
   - However, analgesia was not sustained over 24 hours.
   - Delayed onset and use of rescue medication diminish utility for acute postoperative pain.
