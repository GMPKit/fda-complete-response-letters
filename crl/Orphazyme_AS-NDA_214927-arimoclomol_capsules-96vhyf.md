Dear Mr. Pangu:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated July 17, 2020, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for arimoclomol capsules.  
We acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated December 22, 2020, which extended the goal date by three months.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

You submitted data from a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial together with confirmatory evidence from in vitro, animal and clinical pharmacology data to establish substantial evidence of effectiveness of arimoclomol for the treatment of Neimann-Pick disease Type C (NPC).

We recognize NPC as a rare, serious and life-threatening disease with a high unmet need and no approved therapies. In situations such as this one, we must incorporate regulatory flexibility, while still ensuring there is substantial evidence of effectiveness.

Based upon our review of your submitted data, we are unable to conclude that there is substantial evidence of effectiveness. This conclusion is based on concerns with your 5 domain NPC Clinical Severity Scale (5DNPCCSS) and the weak and contradictory confirmatory evidence of effectiveness, as explained below, which is in the context of a numerically small treatment effect in your trial (treatment difference of about 1 point on a 25 point scale), problematic “hypothetical estimand”, and the lack of statistical significance at the conventional level (p<0.05) on our analysis of the 5DNPCCSS using a while-on-treatment estimand.

---

## TRIAL NPC-002  
### Primary Efficacy Results

As discussed at the pre-NDA meeting, we have concerns with your hypothetical estimand targeted by your primary efficacy analysis for the 5DNPCCSS endpoint, which yielded:

- Treatment difference: -1.4 points  
- 95% CI: (-2.8, 0.0)  
- p-value: 0.046

Our main efficacy evaluation focused on the while-on-treatment estimand:

- Estimated treatment difference: -1.2  
- 95% CI: (-2.7, 0.3)  
- p-value: 0.12  

This does not meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance (p<0.05) and is numerically small relative to the 0 to 25 range for the 5DNPCCSS.

---

## 5DNPCCSS Regulatory History

- September 2, 2016: Expressed concerns regarding insufficiently defined domains; recommended performance-based assessments.  
- January 19, 2017: Reiterated concerns on standardization; requested evidence for domain reliability and reproducibility.  
- July 20, 2017: Noted lack of incorporation of prior feedback; emphasized need for valid and standardized performance tests.  
- July 10, 2019: Reiterated that adequacy of 5DNPCCSS would be an NDA review issue due to lack of assessment before trial unblinding.

---

## 5DNPCCSS Validity Concerns

- No comparative data submitted to validate 5DNPCCSS domains.  
- Concerns with the swallow domain regarding clinical severity alignment.  
- Inconsistencies in scoring levels and lack of score ordering reflecting severity.  
- Baseline score imbalances may affect improvement opportunities.  
- Misalignment between NPCCSS and ASHA-NOMS/PAS data.

### Swallow Domain Specific Issues

- Same score assigned to clinically distinct cases.  
- Baseline imbalances may bias observed improvements.  
- ASHA-NOMS and PAS scales inconsistent with NPCCSS scoring.

### Other Domain-Specific Concerns

- Ambulation items insufficiently reflect current function.  
- Cognition assessments may reflect access to services more than ability.  
- Fine motor terminology is vague ("slight" vs "mild").

---

## CONFIRMATORY EVIDENCE

Confirmatory evidence is weak and contradictory:

- In vitro concentrations needed for NPC1 expression exceed clinical exposure levels.  
- Animal models (GLP and non-GLP) produced inconsistent or non-reproducible results.  
- Publications such as Kirkegaard et al. provide inconclusive or questionable data.  
- Biomarker assessments largely inconclusive:

  - Lyso-SM-509:  
    - Reduced at 6 months (p=0.05)  
    - Not significant at 12 months (p=0.40); clinical relevance unclear.

  - HSP70: Increased in both treatment and placebo; data incomplete.  
  - Unesterified cholesterol and cholestane-triol: No statistical significance; high variability.

---

## INFORMATION NEEDED TO RESOLVE THE DEFICIENCIES

### 1. Address 5DNPCCSS Limitations

- Rescore NPCCSS if feasible.  
- Align scores with NIH natural history data.  
- Analyze score directionality/bias.

### 2. Validate 5DNPCCSS Scores

- Conduct clinical expert interviews.  
- Submit longitudinal validity data using validated tools.

### 3. Trial NPC-002 Further Data

- Include biopsy data across timepoints.  
- Highlight patient-level meaningful changes.  
- Explore key subgroups (e.g., double-null genotype, miglustat co-administration).

### 4. Improve Confirmatory Evidence

- Conduct cross-over pharmacodynamic studies.  
- Add skin biopsy data using validated endpoints.

---

## ADVISORY COMMITTEE

This application may be discussed at an advisory committee meeting in a future review cycle.

---

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

- Trial NPC-002 involved only NPC Type 1 patients.  
- A robust scientific rationale is required to support inclusion of NPC Type 2.

---
