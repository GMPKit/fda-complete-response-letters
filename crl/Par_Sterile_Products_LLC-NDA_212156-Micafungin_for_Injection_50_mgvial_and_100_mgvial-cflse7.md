Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated July 18, 2019, received July 18, 2019, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Micafungin for Injection, 50 mg/vial and 100 mg/vial.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated April 6, 2020, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## PRODUCT QUALITY

1. Regarding the compatibility studies in your Pharmaceutical Development Report, we note the assay values are mg/mL at time and mg/mL at hours for the 5% dextrose diluted admixture of 100 mg drug product as shown in Table 7-4 on page 126 of 134. The assay value of mg/mL is more than % off from the target 0.5 mg/mL concentration and this could affect the efficacy of the drug product.  
   **Action**: Conduct a root cause analysis to determine the reason for the low assay value. After determining the cause and correcting, reconduct the assay test of the in-use-stability study to support labeling.

2. Regarding the drug product specification:
   - a. The proposed acceptance criterion for Impurity is NMT %. Tighten the limit to NMT 0.2% per ICH Q3B or provide toxicology data to justify the limit.
   - b. The proposed acceptance criterion for specified impurity at is NMT %. The limit is above the qualification threshold. Justify the limit with toxicology data. Alternatively, tighten the limit to NMT 0.2% per ICH Q3B.
   - c. The limit NMT % for any unspecified impurity is above the qualification threshold. Tighten the limit per ICH Q3B.

---

## NONCLINICAL

1. Provide your revised leachables assessment, including the toxicological assessment you planned to provide for on July 31, 2020. The adequacy of your revised leachables study will be assessed at time of resubmission.

2. As noted in the product quality comments above, the proposed acceptance criterion for:
   - Impurity (NMT %)
   - Impurity at (NMT %)
   - Any unspecified impurity (NMT %)

   These are above the ICH Q3B qualification thresholds of NMT 0.2%. If the acceptance criterion cannot be tightened to NMT 0.2%, provide:
   - Adequate characterization for impurity at and any unspecified impurity(ies)
   - Comprehensive toxicological assessment for all impurities greater than 0.2% when administered intravenously

   If sufficient toxicity information is not available, additional nonclinical studies may be recommended.

Refer to:
- [ICH Q3B(R1): Impurities in New Drug Products](https://www.fda.gov/media/71733/download)
- [ICH M7(R1): Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals](https://www.fda.gov/media/85885/download)

## FACILITY INSPECTIONS

An inspection of the facility is required before the application can be approved in order to assess CGMP compliance.

Due to government- or agency-wide travel restrictions, we were unable to conduct the inspection during this review cycle. You may respond to the other deficiencies noted in this letter in the meantime. However, the application cannot be approved until an FDA inspection is completed and assessed.
