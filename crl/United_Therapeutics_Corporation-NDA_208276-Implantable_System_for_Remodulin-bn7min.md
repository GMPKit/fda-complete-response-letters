Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) originally submitted December 26, 2015, received December 26, 2015, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, for Implantable System for Remodulin (treprostinil) solution for injection.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated December 15, 2016, which constituted a complete response to our October 8, 2016, action letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

---

## CLINICAL

1. As noted in our October 8, 2016, Complete Response letter, the device component of this combination product received a Not Approvable letter on the PMA on March 11, 2016.

   - Until such time as the device is determined to be approvable for use in combination with your proposed drug under this NDA, your NDA for the drug-device combination product cannot be approved.

2. Sufficient human factors (HF) data has not been provided to demonstrate that the Implantable System for Remodulin (ISR) user interface supports safe and effective use for the intended users, uses, and use environments.

   - The original HF deficiencies included in the Not Approvable letter issued by FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) on March 11, 2016 and the HF deficiencies identified by CDRH on February 9, 2017 remain outstanding.
   - Pursuant to 21 CFR 820.30, the ISR user interface, including the training plan, should be optimized and validated prior to approval.
  
   **Recommendations:**
   - Re-evaluation of the HF validation study results  
   - Implementation of additional mitigations  
   - Finalize the intended training program  
   - Submit additional HF validation data  
   - Submit the HF validation study protocol to the Agency for review and feedback prior to starting the study

---

## PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

3. We reserve final comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. However, we have decided to incorporate the use of the Implantable System for Remodulin into the existing Remodulin label.

   **Recommendations:**
   - Propose a unified Prescribing Information incorporating use of the Implantable System for Remodulin in the existing Remodulin label
   - Utilize the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) checklist
   - Submit updated labeling in SPL format  
   - Include:
     - Highlighted/marked-up copy showing all changes  
     - Clean Microsoft Word version  
     - Annotations that support the proposed changes  

---

## PROPRIETARY NAME

4. Please refer to correspondence dated April 7, 2017, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, Implantable System for Remodulin. This name was found acceptable pending approval of the application in the current review cycle.

   - Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

---

2. Update discontinuations, serious and common adverse events:
   - Present new safety data using the same format as original

## ADDITIONAL APPLICATION ISSUES (NDA 208276)

### CLINICAL

1. The device under PMA received a Not Approvable letter on March 11, 2016.  
   - NDA for drug-device product cannot be approved until device is approved.

### PRODUCT QUALITY

2. Insufficient data to evaluate microbial contamination risk via the implantable pump system.

   - Based on Medtronic’s May 24, 2016 response to FDA’s May 8, 2016 request:
     - The response suggests that the pump is a “closed system”
     - However, evidence is lacking to demonstrate that microbial ingress cannot occur at the catheter tip

   **Requirement:**
   - Provide data confirming the closed system status of the catheter tip

---

3. No final comment until adequacy is confirmed.

   - Review resources:
     - PLR Requirements for Prescribing Information
