### NONCLINICAL

1. **Triacetin Reproductive and Developmental Studies**  
   You have not provided adequate data to support your request for a waiver of reproductive and developmental studies for triacetin.

   **Information needed to resolve deficiency:**
   - Provide data to support that triacetin levels are not present in systemic circulation.
   - Conduct reproductive and developmental toxicology studies with triacetin or justify previous data.

2. **Safety of DMSO and Triacetin**  
   You have not provided adequate data to support the safety of DMSO or triacetin; levels exceed limits listed in the CDER Inactive Ingredient Database (IID).

   **Information needed to resolve deficiency:**
   - Submit data on DMSO and triacetin's impact on all standard reproductive and developmental endpoints.
   - Justify literature with current study protocol standards or conduct new GLP toxicology studies.

3. **Maleic Acid Embryo-Fetal Development**  
   Toxicological risk assessment does not include embryo-fetal impact in a second species.

   **Information needed to resolve deficiency:**
   - Submit justification for safety of maximum daily dose of maleic acid, especially on rabbit embryo-fetal development.

4. **Degradant Qualification**  
   Proposed degradant exceeds threshold under ICH Q3B(R2).

   **Information needed to resolve deficiency:**
   - Tighten the drug product specification to an acceptable limit.
   - Or provide qualification data:
     - A genetic toxicology screen including:
       - One point mutation assay  
       - One chromosome aberration assay

### PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

- We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is adequate.
- Review PLR and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule resources.
- Use the SRPI checklist to ensure format compliance.
- Response must include updated labeling content [21 CFR 314.50(l)(1)(i)] in SPL format.  
  [Structured Product Labeling Standards](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm)

---

### PROPRIETARY NAME

- Refer to correspondence dated December 6, 2019 (and January 25, 2019).
- Name “ZYNRELEF” was found acceptable pending application approval.
- Resubmit name with your response to deficiencies.

---

### SAFETY UPDATE

Response to deficiencies must include a safety update per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b):

1. Describe any changes/findings in the safety profile.
2. For new adverse event data:
   - Present using original submission format.
   - Include tabulations of new and original data.
   - Compare frequencies of adverse events.
   - Provide separate tables for other indications.
3. Retabulate reasons for trial discontinuation; address new trends or patterns.
4. Submit case report forms and narrative summaries:
   - For all deaths in trials.
   - For discontinuations due to adverse events.
   - For serious adverse events.
5. Describe substantial changes in incidence of common but less serious events.
6. Provide updated exposure info (e.g., number of subjects, person time).
7. Summarize worldwide safety experience; include updated usage estimates.
8. Provide English translations of foreign labeling not previously submitted.

---

### ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

Not approvability issues, but require attention:

1. **Bupivacaine Exposure Limit**  
   Data support dosing up to 300 mg only. For 400 mg, exposures exceed referenced product.

2. **Dose Volume Discrepancy**  
   Inconsistencies in “Maximum intended dose volume (mL)” (Table 2, section 3.2.P.1).  
   - Provide revised Table 2 with corrected theoretical volume to 2 decimal points.

3. **Viscosity and Syringeability Testing**  
   Due to temperature sensitivity:
   - Test 'dynamic viscosity' of HTX-011 at 15°C and 25°C.
   - Conduct 'syringeability' studies simulating IFU preparation and use.

4. **DMSO Specification Upper Limit**  
   Proposed upper limit for DMSO has never been clinically or nonclinically tested.  
   - Revise specification, conduct studies, or justify safety at proposed levels.

---

### PREA PMRs (Required Postmarketing Requirements Upon Approval)

1. Conduct juvenile animal study in rodent model to assess DMSO effect on developing brain (patients <3 years).
2. Conduct juvenile animal study in appropriate model to assess meloxicam effect on kidney, liver, lung, and testes (patients <3 years).

---

### OTHER

- Resubmit or take action within one year per 21 CFR 314.110.
- If no action is taken, application may be deemed withdrawn under 21 CFR 314.65.
