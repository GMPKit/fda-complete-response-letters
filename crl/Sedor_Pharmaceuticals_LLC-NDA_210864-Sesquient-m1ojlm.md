# CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH

## APPLICATION NUMBER: 210864Orig1s000  
**NDA 210864**  
**Complete Response ‚Äì Sedor Pharmaceuticals, LLC**  

Attention: Rick Lampe  
Director of Regulatory Affairs & Quality Assurance

## PRODUCT QUALITY

Information provided to date has not adequately addressed the issue of foreign particles in the drug product.

In a quality information amendment submitted on December 6, 2019, the study results provided did not contain sufficient data (e.g., documentation of environmental conditions during testing) to confirm claims that earlier particulate data were erroneous.

### Required Actions

- Characterize the particles observed in the drug product.
- Identify the root cause of their presence (e.g., container closure system, testing method/conditions, manufacturing equipment).
- Provide a Risk Mitigation & Control Plan.
- Provide data to demonstrate actions taken will prevent particle reoccurrence.

## REGULATORY

### 1. Application Reliance on Previously Approved NDAs

You relied in part on FDA‚Äôs findings for:

- NDA 020450 (Cerebyx)
- NDA 208611 (Baxdela‚Ñ¢)
- NDA 206030 (Carnexiv‚Ñ¢)
- NDA 021267 (Vfend¬Æ)
- NDA 211371 (Zulresso‚Ñ¢)

FDA determined reliance on NDA 206030 (Carnexiv) is needed to justify Captisol safety.

‚úÖ Please submit an updated FDA Form 356h reflecting reliance on Cerebyx and Carnexiv only.

### 2. Paragraph IV Certifications

You submitted Paragraph IV certifications regarding U.S. Patents under Carnexiv NDA 206030:

- 7,635,773
- 8,410,077
- 9,493,582
- 9,750,822

You must:

- Send notice of Paragraph IV certification to the NDA holder and patent owner (Cydex Pharmaceuticals).
- Submit documentation of the date of receipt of such notices.

### 3. Delivery Documentation

You previously submitted Domestic Return Receipts dated September 23, 2019, for deliveries to Lundbeck Pharmaceuticals.

‚ùå Receipts did not include the delivery date in field C of PS Form 3811.  
üìÑ Please submit documentation showing delivery date.
