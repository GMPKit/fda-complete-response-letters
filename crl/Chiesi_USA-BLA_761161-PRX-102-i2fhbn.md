## BLA 761161 — COMPLETE RESPONSE

**To:**  
Chiesi USA  
Attention: Matt Medlin, PhD, RAC  
Sr. Manager, US Regulatory Affairs R&D  
175 Regency Woods Place, Suite 600  
Cary, NC 27518  

Dear Dr. Medlin:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated and received May 27, 2020, and your amendments, under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for PRX-102.

We acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated November 4, 2020, which extended the goal date by three months.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## DEFICIENCIES AND INFORMATION NEEDED TO RESOLVE THE DEFICIENCIES

### 1. Facilities

During a review of records requested under section 704(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, we communicated issues with the manufacturing facility named in your application. Satisfactory resolution of the remaining issues is required before this application may be approved.

We will communicate the outstanding issues to the facility no later than 10 business days after issuing this complete response letter. Contact the manufacturing facility for additional information.

### 2. Use of the Accelerated Approval Pathway When There is Available Therapy

You requested accelerated approval of PRX-102 based on a reduction in renal peritubular capillary globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) inclusions. As previously communicated on March 15, 2021, with the full approval of Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) on March 11, 2021, Fabrazyme is now available therapy for Fabry disease.

Your product will no longer qualify for accelerated approval if it does not provide a therapeutic advantage over available therapy. We acknowledge your response dated March 26, 2021. Given the late timing of this development in the review cycle we have not completed our review of that amendment.

Prior to your resubmission, we recommend an End-of-Review meeting to discuss whether accelerated approval remains an appropriate pathway for your product. That discussion should also include:

- A status update on your ongoing intended confirmatory postmarketing trial, and  
- Your assessment of the likelihood that this trial will be able to show superiority of your product to Fabrazyme on eGFR, based on what is known with regard to the effects of these products on renal Gb3 inclusions, and  
- Your plans should that trial fail to show superiority of PRX-102 over Fabrazyme.

An alternative approach to seeking accelerated approval may be to establish that the reduction in renal Gb3 inclusions with PRX-102 predicts clinical benefit, allowing for full approval of your product. Data to support such an approach should show that:

- Gb3 is toxic to tissues when it accumulates  
- Gb3 accumulates in all tissues where Fabry disease causes structural damage and functional loss  
- The degree of Gb3 accumulation is correlated with the degree of tissue damage  
- A reduction in Gb3 is associated with normalization of structure and function  
- PRX-102 sufficiently removes Gb3 from Fabry target tissues, including in women  

We recommend also discussing whether full approval may be a possible path forward for your product at the End-of-Review meeting.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

### 1. Inspection of Manufacturing Facility

An inspection of Protalix Ltd. (FEI# 3008289067), Carmiel, Israel is required prior to approval. Due to travel restrictions, we were unable to conduct this inspection during the current review cycle.

Even if deficiencies are addressed, the application cannot be approved until the inspection is conducted and findings are assessed.

For further information, refer to [FDA COVID-19 Guidance](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-related-guidance-documents-industry-fda-staff-and-other-stakeholders).

### 2. Infusion-Related Reactions

Concerns noted on your 2-hour window for infusion-related reactions. Clarify reasoning for excluding certain adverse events and provide a clearer narrative on premedication.

Include in next review cycle:

- Dataset and assessment of all infusion-related reactions within 24 hours  
- Details on excluded events attributed to infusion procedure  
- Patient narratives for all subjects who received premedication (including medication details and reasoning)
