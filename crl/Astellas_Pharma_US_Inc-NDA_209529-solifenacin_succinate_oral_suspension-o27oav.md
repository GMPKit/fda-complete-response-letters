**COMPLETE RESPONSE**  

Astellas Pharma US, Inc.  
Attention: Jennifer M. LaMora  
Associate Director, Regulatory Affairs  
1 Astellas Way  
Northbrook, IL 60062  

Dear Ms. LaMora:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated February 28, 2017, received February 28, 2017, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for solifenacin succinate oral suspension, 1 mg/mL.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

## Deficiencies

1. During a recent inspection of the manufacturing facility for this NDA, our field investigator observed objectionable conditions at the facility. Satisfactory resolution of the observations is required before this NDA may be approved.

2. The quality of material as currently supplied is not adequately controlled, resulting in drug product batches that do not meet the proposed drug product specification.

3. The drug product specification and post-approval stability program do not include the test methods and acceptance criteria to demonstrate that the product is free, and remains free, of objectionable microorganisms.

## Information Needed to Address the Deficiencies

To address the first two deficiencies, submit the following information:

- Results from ongoing characterization studies, including a summary of investigations and the corrective and preventive actions taken to address the root cause.
- Establish and validate additional tests and acceptance criteria as needed.
- Batch analyses from three verification/validation batches demonstrating that drug product manufactured with conforming materials has the requisite quality (e.g., viscosity). Include executed batch records from the validation batches along with the validation protocol and final summary report.

If suitable additional controls cannot be identified and validated or if the supplier cannot provide material that meets the enhanced raw material specification, revision of acceptance criteria for drug product viscosity may be proposed. Provide justification and confirm that drug product quality and performance, including homogeneity, is not adversely impacted using release and stability data.

To address the third deficiency:

- Revise the drug product specification to include test methods and acceptance criteria to assure the product is free of objectionable microorganisms. Update the relevant sections of the application accordingly.
- Revise the post-approval stability program to include testing to confirm continued absence of objectionable microorganisms.

## Additional Comments

- Update Table 12 in Module 2.3.P to reflect that microbial limit tests will be performed on every batch.
- Under the BPCA (21 U.S.C. 355a), the FDA may publish a notice identifying any pediatric formulation found safe and effective but not introduced to the market within one year of granting exclusivity (August 10, 2017).

## Prescribing Information

Your proposed prescribing information must conform to the requirements in 21 CFR 201.56(a) and (d) and 201.57.

## Carton and Container Labeling

Submit revised carton and container labeling based on the proposed revisions dated May 3, 2017, and May 24, 2017.

## Proprietary Name

The proposed name "VESIcare LS" was found acceptable in correspondence dated May 24, 2017, pending application approval. Resubmit the proprietary name with your response to deficiencies.

## Facility Inspections

During a recent inspection, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies observed at the manufacturing facility. Satisfactory resolution of these is required prior to approval.

## Safety Update

Include a safety update under 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b), covering data from all studies (nonclinical and clinical) regardless of indication, dose, or form.

Include:

1. Detailed description of changes or findings in the safety profile
2. Updated safety tables:
   - New data by indication
   - Combined with original data
   - Comparative frequencies
   - Separate tables for other indications
3. Retabulated reasons for premature trial discontinuation  
4. Case report forms and narrative summaries for deaths and serious AEs
5. Discussion of any substantial changes in incidence of common AEs
6. Updated exposure data (e.g., subjects or person-time)
7. Worldwide safety experience and estimated global usage
8. Translations of previously unsubmitted approved foreign labeling

## Other

You must resubmit within one year or submit a request for an extension (21 CFR 314.110). Failure to respond may result in withdrawal under 21 CFR 314.65.
