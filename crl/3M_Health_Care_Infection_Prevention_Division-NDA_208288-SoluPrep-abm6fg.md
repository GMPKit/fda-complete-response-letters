## COMPLETE RESPONSE – September 1, 2017

**To**:  
3M Health Care (Infection Prevention Division)  
Attention: Dianne Gibbs  
Regulatory Affairs Director, IPD Division  
Building 275-5W-06  
St. Paul, MD 55144-1000

**Subject**: NDA 208288 – SoluPrep™ (2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 70% isopropyl alcohol), solution

---

### NONCLINICAL

- The proposed impurity specifications are above ICH Q3B(R2) qualification thresholds.
- Dermal rabbit study (#16-014) is incomplete for systemic toxicity evaluation.
- Maximal use projections for the 26 mL applicator are not supported by animal-to-human dosing conversions.
- Franz Cell assay data does not replace the need for pharmacokinetic (PK) data.
- Options to address deficiencies:
  - Conduct qualification studies in one species with appropriate tissue analysis and exposure metrics.
  - Provide human PK data from maximal use trial (MUsT).
  - Control impurities based on a comparable approved product and justify impurity specs.

Refer to ICH M3(R2) for study design guidance. Important elements:
- Justify dosing regimen and application duration.
- Evaluate clinical signs, body weights, organ weights, gross pathology, histopathology, toxicokinetics.
- Evaluate both immediate and delayed systemic or local effects.

---

### SAFETY UPDATE

Submit updates per 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b):

1. Describe changes/findings in the safety profile.
2. Include:
   - New safety data in original format
   - Combined and comparative data tables
   - Separate AE tables for additional indications
3. Retabulate premature trial discontinuation reasons.
4. Provide case report forms and narratives for deaths or SAEs.
5. Describe any changes in incidence of common AEs.
6. Provide updated exposure database (subjects, person-time).
7. Provide a global safety usage summary.
8. Submit English translations of foreign labeling not previously submitted.

---

### CHEMISTRY, MANUFACTURING AND CONTROLS

- Tentative impurity specifications accepted as final impurity qualification is lacking.
- Updated drug product specifications remain tentative.

---

### OTHER

- Resubmission must fully address all deficiencies.
- Label cover letter as **RESUBMISSION**.
- A partial response does not start a new review cycle.
- Request a meeting per FDA Guidance: [Formal Meetings (March 2015)](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm437431.pdf)
- Marketing is prohibited until formal approval.

## COMPLETE RESPONSE – May 6, 2016

**To**:  
3M Health Care (Infection Prevention Division)  
Attention: Dianne Gibbs  
Regulatory Affairs Director, IPD Division  
3M Center  
Building 275-5W-06  
St. Paul, MN 55144-1000  

**Subject**: NDA 208288 – SoluPrep™ Film-Forming Sterile Surgical Solution (2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 70% isopropyl alcohol)

---

### CLINICAL

1. Pivotal study EM-05-012760 met primary endpoints.  
   Study EM-05-013260 failed at the inguinal site.  
   → Repeat inguinal study with proper controls.

2. Financial disclosure inadequate:
   - Missing data for subinvestigators in both studies.
   - Provide efforts made to obtain data and assess bias risk.
   - Submit subject-level sensitivity analyses dropping affected cases.
   - Submit required datasets including subinvestigator info per subject.

---

### CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

- Literature references for PK of isopropyl alcohol/chlorhexidine are insufficient.
- To resolve:
  - Rely on adequate literature for similar use
  - Use FDA findings from listed drug(s)
  - Or conduct maximal use PK study on final formulation

---

### NONCLINICAL

- Impurity qualification data for certain unidentified impurities is missing.
- Must comply with ICH Q3B(R2):  
  [ICH Q3B(R2) Guidance Link](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073389.pdf)

---

### PRODUCT QUALITY

- Proposed impurity limits exceed ICH thresholds.
- Shelf-life specs unacceptable due to rising impurity levels.
- Impurity exceeds <1.0%; no expiration date granted.
- Conduct justification studies for specifications.

---

### MICROBIOLOGY

1. **CCIT Method**: Headspace method detects only large defects (≥50μm); invalid for microbial ingress.  
   - Provide validated alternative CCIT detecting microbial ingress.

2. **Pouch CCIT**: Submit test data, controls, method, and results.

3. **Production Monitoring**:  
   - Clarify batch consistency for 10.5 mL and 26.0 mL ampules.  
   - Revise SOP for requalification schedule.

4. **Sample Clarity**:  
   - Clarify 44 stability samples vs 2 tested for bioburden.  
   - Specify source, lot numbers, and clarification of remaining 44 samples.

5. **Bioburden Testing (STP00036)**:
   - Define microorganisms used.  
   - Describe rinsing/neutralization steps.  
   - Provide recovery validation data.

6. **Sterility Validation Reports**:  
   - Clarify discrepancies and protocol consistency among 201404182 / 201401236.  
   - Address missing results in Phase 2 validation.

7. **Sterility Testing for DP Release**:  
   - Clearly define validated sterility method.  
   - Do not use “backup” method for release.

8. **Stability Program**:  
   - CCIT in place of sterility testing acceptable.  
   - Include validated CCIT in stability specs.

9. **Drug Product Applicator**:  
   - Add sterility or CCIT requirements.

---

### ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

#### CLINICAL

1. Specify literature supporting labeling not derived from your data (e.g., warnings, use limitations).
2. Discuss drape adhesion study design relevance to clinical practice.
3. Explain potential bias mitigation in small, open-label studies.
4. Submit datasets from study EM-05-013260 (Listings 16.2.8.1/2) with/without HEDTA.
