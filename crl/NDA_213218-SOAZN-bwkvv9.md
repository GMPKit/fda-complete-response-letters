## PROPRIETARY NAME

Please refer to the correspondence dated December 19, 2019, which addresses the proposed proprietary name, SOAANZ. This name was found conditionally acceptable pending approval of the application. Please resubmit the proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

## SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b).

The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. When assembling the sections describing:
   - Discontinuations due to adverse events,
   - Serious adverse events,
   - Common adverse events,  
   Incorporate new safety data as follows:

   - Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication using the same format as in the original submission.
   - Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application data.
   - Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application with the retabulated frequencies described above.
   - For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.

4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of subjects, person time).

7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.

8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.

## NEXT STEPS AND REQUIREMENTS

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions available under 21 CFR 314.120.

If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65.

You may also request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly marked with **"RESUBMISSION"** in large font, bold type at the beginning of the cover letter of the submission.

The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial response to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your meeting request as described in the draft guidance for industry â€” Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products.

The drug product may not be legally marketed until you have been notified in writing that this application is approved.

If you have any questions, please call Maryam Changizi, Regulatory Project Manager, at 301-796-5758.

Sincerely,
