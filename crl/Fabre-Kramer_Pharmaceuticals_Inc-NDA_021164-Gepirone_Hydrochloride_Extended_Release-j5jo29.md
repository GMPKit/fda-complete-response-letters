## LETTER 1  
### Date: November 2, 2007  
### To:  
Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Stephen J. Kramer, M.D., Chief Executive Officer  
5847 San Felipe, Suite 2000  
Houston, Texas 77057  

### Drug:  
Gepirone Hydrochloride Extended Release  
20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablets  

### Subject: Not Approvable Action  

---

### Non-Approval Deficiencies  

#### Deficiency 1: Lack of Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness  
- Only 2 well-controlled positive trials (FKGBE007 and 134001) among 12 submitted  
- 10 studies failed to show effectiveness or trends  
- 3 studies showed active comparators statistically superior to gepirone ER:

| Trial        | Comparator | Comparator vs Gepirone ER |
|--------------|------------|----------------------------|
| ORG 134004   | Fluoxetine | -1.71 (p=0.027)            |
| ORG 134017   | Fluoxetine | -1.54 (p=0.042)            |
| ORG 134006   | Paroxetine | -1.85 (p=0.012)            |

- 2 trials where active comparator was superior to placebo but gepirone ER was not:

| Trial       | Comparator  | Act Comp vs Pbo | Gepirone ER vs Pbo |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| CN105-053   | Imipramine  | -3.19 (p=0.038)  | -2.00 (p=0.190)     |
| ORG 134006  | Paroxetine  | -1.63 (p=0.026)  | 0.22 (p=0.760)      |

- Meta-analysis of 10 failed trials: effect size -0.09 (p=0.62)  
- Meta-analysis of all 12 trials: effect size -0.48 (p=0.09)

#### Deficiency 2: Negative Outcome in Longer-Term Study 28709  
- Post-hoc exclusion of 40 patients considered invalid  
- Trial failed: design almost never produces negative results  
- Weakens any claim of long-term efficacy  

#### General Conclusion:  
- Gepirone ER shows significantly less efficacy than standard antidepressants  
- Inadequate for serious illness like MDD  
- Slightly better sexual dysfunction profile does not offset effectiveness concerns  

---

### Additional CMC Deficiencies  
1. Revise acceptance criterion for individual unspecified impurity per ICH Q3B  
2. Provide long-term and accelerated stability data for the commercial drug product  

You must respond within 10 days or we will consider the application withdrawn per 21 CFR 314.65.

## LETTER 2  
### Date: June 23, 2004  
### To:  
Organon, Inc.  
Edna Gilvary, Ph.D., Regulatory Scientist II  
375 Mount Pleasant Avenue  
West Orange, NJ 07052  

### Subject: Not Approvable Action  
Re: Gepirone Hydrochloride ER 20–80 mg tablets  

---

### Nonapproval Deficiencies  

#### Deficiency 1: Effectiveness Still Not Established  
- Only one positive short-term study in ER (134001)  
- IR study 03A7A-003 has diagnostic population concerns  
- ER study 134004 failed (fluoxetine nearly significantly better than gepirone)  
- Study 28709 (randomized withdrawal) is negative

##### Study 28709 results (CMH analysis):  
- Gepirone: 29/126 (23%)  
- Placebo: 43/124 (35%)  
- p = 0.024  

- Re-inclusion of 5 relapsed patients:  
  - Gepirone: 34/126 (27%)  
  - p = 0.101

##### Secondary Endpoint - Time to Relapse:  
- Original: p = 0.089  
- With 5 patients added: p = 0.28  

#### Deficiency 2: Meta-analysis concerns  
- 2 positive trials among 19 total short-term trials  
- Only 1 of 5 short-term ER studies was positive  

---

### Additional Comments and Requests  

#### Proposed Tradename  
- "Variza" and "Alrize" rejected by DMETS  
- Submit another proposed tradename  

#### Labeling Suggestions  
A. **Blister**  
- Include strength, net quantity, content statement  

B. **Professional Sample**  
- See A-2 and A-4  

C. **Container**  
- Increase prominence of established name  
- Relocate strength below name  
- Use color/boxing to differentiate strengths  
- Add CRC statement  

D. **Carton**  
- See C-1, 3, 4  

---

### Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC)  
1. Provide updated stability protocol  
2. Withdraw site (Organon Inc. Sub Akzona Inc.) from NDA  

---

### Clinical Pharmacology  
1. Modified tablet shapes evaluated only for 20 and 80 mg — 40 and 60 mg not acceptable  
2. Interim dissolution specs acceptable, reassess after 20 batches:  
   - 15–25% at 1 h  
   - 40–85% at 5 h  
   - 65–86% at 12 h  
   - >86% at 20 h  
3. Phase 4 commitments:  
   - Study on intermediate inducers (e.g., rifabutin)  
   - Food effect study underway  
   - Re-evaluate dissolution spec after 20 batches

### Subject: Not Approvable Action  

---

### Nonapproval Deficiencies  

#### 1. Lack of Substantial Evidence of Efficacy  
- ER study 134001 accepted as positive  
- IR Study 03A7A-003: diagnostic concerns due to low HAMD-17  
- IR Study 03A7C-001-B: results driven by one center (Cole)

#### Negative Studies Without Explanation  
- Trials: 134002, CN105-078, CN105-083  
- Only 1 positive ER study out of 4  
- Recommend: One additional positive (e.g., dose-response) study  

---

#### 2. Inadequate Long-Term Safety Data  
- Fewer than 124 subjects exposed >6 months at >40 mg  
- Fewer than 35 exposed for 1 year
